/**
 * FlowQuery is jQuery for PHP, a selector and traversal engine for object sets.
 *
 * It is specifically implemented for being used inside Eel, the Embedded Expression
 * Language for Flow.
 *
 * Essentially, a FlowQuery object is a container for an *ordered set* of objects
 * of a certain type. On this container, *operations* can be applied (like
 * filter(), children(), ...).
 *
 * All of these operations work on a *set*, that is, an operation usually expands
 * or shrinks the set of objects.
 *
 * An operation normally returns a new FlowQuery instance with the operation applied,
 * but there are also some operations like is(...) or count(), which return simple
 * types like boolean or numbers. We call these operations *final operations*.
 *
 * Internal Workings
 * =================
 *
 * To allow for optimization, calling operations are not immediately executed.
 * Instead, they are appended to a *list of operations*. Only if one tries to
 * iterate over the FlowQuery object or calls a final operation, the operations
 * get executed and the result is computed.
 *
 * Implementation of Operations
 * ----------------------------
 *
 * Operations are implemented by implementing the {@link OperationInterface} or,
 * more commonly, subclassing the {@link Operations/AbstractOperation}.
 *
 * An operation must be *equivalence preserving*, that is, the following equation
 * must always hold:
 *
 * applyAllOperations(context) = applyRemainingOperations(applyOperation(context))
 *
 * While an operation is running, it can *add new operations* to the front of the
 * operation queue (with {@link pushOperation()}), so for example count($filter)
 * can first apply filter($filter), followed by count(). However, when doing this,
 * great care must be applied by the operation developer in order to still have
 * finite runs, and to make sure the operation is *equivalence preserving*.
 *
 * Furthermore, an operation can *pop* its following operations from the operation
 * stack, and *peek* what the next operation is. It is up to the operation developer
 * to ensure equivalence preservation.
 *
 * An operation may *never* invoke __call() on the FlowQuery object it receives;
 * as this might lead to an undefined state; i.e. you are not allowed to do:
 * $flowQuery->someOtherOperation() *inside* an operation.
 *
 * Final Operations
 * ----------------
 *
 * If an operation is final, it should return the resulting value directly.
