Domain-Driven Design is a development technique which focuses on understanding
the customer's problem domain. It not only contains a set of technical
ideas, but it also consists of techniques to structure the creativity in
the development process.

The key of Domain-Driven Design is understanding the customers
needs, and also the environment in which the customer works. The problem
which the to-be-written program should solve is called the
*problem domain*, and in Domain-Driven Design,
development is guided by the exploration of the problem domain.

While talking to the customer to understand his needs and wishes,
the developer creates a model which reflects the current understanding
of the problem. This model is called *Domain Model*
because it should accurately reflect the problem domain of the customer.
Then, the domain model is tested with real use-cases, trying to
understand if it fits to the customer's processes and way of working.
Then, the model is refined again -- and the whole process of discussion
with the customer starts again. Thus, Domain-Driven Design is an
iterative approach to software development.

Still, Domain-Driven Design is very pragmatic, as code is created
very early on (instead of extensive requirements specifications); and
real-world problems thus occur very early in the development process,
where they can be easily corrected. Normally, it takes some iterations
of model refinement until a domain model adequately reflects the problem
domain, focusing on the important properties, and leaving out
unimportant ones.

In the following sections, some core components of Domain-Driven
Design are explained. It starts with an approach to create a ubiquitous
language, and then focuses on the technical realization of the domain
model. After that, it is quickly explained how Flow enables
Domain-Driven Design, such that the reader gets a more practical
understanding of it.

.. note::
 We do not explain all details of Domain-Driven Design in this
 work, as only parts of it are important for the general understanding
 needed for this work. More information can be found at [Evans].

Creating a Ubiquitous Language
-------------------------------

In a typical enterprise software project, a multitude of
different roles are involved: For instance, the customer is an expert
in his business, and he wants to use software to solve a certain
problem for him. Thus, he has a very clear idea on the interactions of
the to-be-created software with the environment, and he is one of the
people who need to use the software on a daily basis later on. Because
he has much knowledge about how the software is used, we call him the
*Domain Expert*.

On the other hand, there are the developers who actually need to
implement the software. While they are very skilled in applying
certain technologies, they often are no experts in the problem domain.
Now, developers and domain experts speak a very different language,
and misconceptions happen very often.

To reduce miscommunication, a *ubiquitous
language* should be formed, in which key terms of the
problem domain are described in a language understandable to both the
domain expert and the developer. Thus, the developers learn to use the
correct language of the problem domain right from the beginning, and
can express themselves in a better way when discussing with the domain
expert. Furthermore, they should also use the ubiquitous language
throughout all parts of the project: Not only in communication, design
documents and documentation, but the key terms should also appear in
the domain model. Names of classes, methods and properties are also
part of the ubiquitous language.

By using the language of the domain expert also in the code, it
is possible to discuss about difficult-to-specify functionality by
looking at the code together with the domain expert. This is
especially helpful for complex calculations or difficult-to-specify
condition rules. Thus, the domain expert can decide whether the
business logic was correctly implemented.

Creating a ubiquitous language involves creating a glossary, in
which the key terms are explained in a way both understandable to the
domain expert and the developer. This glossary is also updated
throughout the project, to reflect new insights gained in the
development process.

Modelling the domain
--------------------

Now, while discussing the problem with the domain expert, the
developer starts to create the domain model, and refines it step by
step. Usually, UML is employed for that, which just contains the
relevant information of the problem domain.

The domain model consists of objects (as DDD is a technique for
object-oriented languages), the so-called *Domain
Objects*.

There are two types of domain objects, called
*Entities* and *Value Objects*.
If a domain object has a certain *identity* which
stays the same as the objects changes its state, the object is an
*entity*. Otherwise, if the identity of an object
is only defined from *all properties*, it is a
*value object*. We will now explain these two types
of objects in detail, including practical use-cases.

Furthermore, association mapping is explained, and aggregates
are introduced as a way to further structure the code.

Entities
~~~~~~~~

Entities have a unique identity, which stays the same despite
of changes in the properties of the object. For example, a user can
have a user name as identity, a student a matriculation ID.
Although properties of the objects can change over time (for example
the student changes his courses), it is still the same object. Thus,
the above examples are *entities*.

The identity of an object is given by an immutable property or
a combination of them. In some use-cases it can make a lot of sense
to define identity properties in a way which is *meaningful
in the domain context*: If building an application which
interfaces with a package tracking system, the tracking ID of a
package should be used as identity inside the system. Doing so will
reduce the risk of inconsistent data, and can also speed up
access.

For some domain objects like a ``Person``, it is
highly dependent on the problem domain what should be used as
identity property. In an internet forum, the e-mail address is often
used as identity property for people, while when implementing an
e-government application, one might use the passport ID to uniquely
identify citizens (which nobody would use in the web forum because
its data is too sensible).

In case the developer does not specify an identity property,
the framework assigns a universally unique identifier (UUID) to the
object at creation time.

It is important to stress that identity properties need to be
set *at object creation time*, i.e. inside the
constructor of an object, and are not allowed to change throughout
the whole object lifetime. As we will see later, the object will be
referenced using its identity properties, and a change of an
identity property would effectively wipe one object and create a new
one without updating dependent objects, leaving the system in an
inconsistent state.

In a typical system, many domain objects will be
*entities*. However, for some use-cases, another
type is a lot better suited: Value objects, which are explained in
the next section.

Value Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PHP provides several value types which it supports internally:
Integer, float, string, float and array. However, it is often the
case that you need more complex types of values inside your domain.
These are being represented using *value
objects*.

The identity of a value object is defined by *all its
properties*. Thus, two objects are equal if all properties
are equal. For instance, in a painting program, the concept of
*color* needs to be somewhere implemented. A
color is only represented through its value, for instance using RGB
notation. If two colors have the same RGB values, they are
effectively similar and do not need to be distinguished
further.

Value objects do not only contain data, they can potentially
contain very much logic, for example for converting the color value
to another color space like HSV or CMYK, even taking color profiles
into account.

As all properties of a value object are part of its identity,
they are not allowed to be changed after the object's creation.
Thus, value objects are *immutable*. The only way
to "change" a value object is to create a new one using the old one
as basis. For example, there might be a method ``mix`` on
the ``Color`` object, which takes another
``Color`` object and mixes both colors. Still, as the
internal state is not allowed to change, the mix method
will effectively return a new ``Color`` object containing
the mixed color values.

As value objects have a very straightforward semantic
definition (similar to the simple data types in many programming
languages), they can easily be created, cloned or transferred to
other subsystems or other computers. Furthermore, it is clearly
communicated that such objects are simple
*values*.

Internally, frameworks can optimize the use of value objects
by re-using them whenever possible, which can greatly reduce the
amount of memory needed for applications.

Entity or Value Object?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An object can not be ultimately categorized into either
being an entity or a value object -- it depends greatly on the use
case. An example illustrates this: For many applications which
need to store an *address*, this address is
clearly a value object - all properties like street, number, or
city contribute to the identity of the object, and the
*address* is only used as container for these
properties.

However, if implementing an application for a postal service
which should optimize letter delivery, not only the address, but
also the person delivering to this location should be stored. This
name of the postman does not belong to the identity of the object,
and can change over time -- a clear sign of
*Address* being an entity in this case. So,
generally it often depends on the use-case whether an object is an
entity or value object.

People new to Domain-Driven Design often tend to overuse
entities, as this is what people coming from a relational database
background are used to.

So why not just use entities all the time?
The design/architectural answer is: because a value object might just
be more fitting your problem at hand.
The technical answer is: because value objects are immutable and
therefore avoid aliasing [#]_ problems, which are common cause
of all kinds of bugs.

Associations
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now, after explaining the two types of domain objects, we will
look at a particularly important implementation area: Associations
between objects.

Domain objects have relationships between them. In the domain
language, these relations are expressed often as follows: A
*consists of* B, C *has* D, E
*processes* F, G *belongs to*
H. These relations are called *associations* in
the domain model.

In the real world, relationships are often inherently
bidirectional, are only active for a certain time span, and can
contain further information. However, when modelling these
relationships as associations, it is important to simplify them as
much as possible, encoding only the relevant information into the
domain model.

Especially complex to implement are bidirectional many-to-many
relations, as they can be traversed in both directions, and consist
of two lists of objects which have to be kept in sync manually in
most programming languages (such as Java or PHP).

Still, especially in the first iterations of refining the
domain model, many-to-many relations are very common. The following
questions can help to simplify them:

* Is the association relevant for the core functionality of
  the application?
  If it is only used in rare use cases and there is another
  way to receive the needed information, it is often better to
  drop the association altogether.

* For bidirectional associations, can they be converted to
  unidirectional associations, because there is a main traversal
  direction?
  Traversing the other direction is still possible by
  querying the underlying persistence system.

* Can the association be qualified more restrictively, for
  example by adding multiplicities on each side?

The more simple the association is, the more directly it can
be mapped to code, and the more clear the intent is.

Aggregates
~~~~~~~~~~

When building a complex domain model, it will contain a lot of
classes, all being on the same hierarchy level. However, often it is
the case that certain objects are parts of a bigger object. For
example, when modeling a ``Car`` domain object for a car
repair shop, it might make sense to also model the wheels and the
engine. As they are a part of the car, this understanding should be
also reflected in our model.

Such a part-whole relationship of closely related objects is
called *Aggregate*. An aggregate contains a root,
the so-called *Aggregate Root*, which is
responsible for the integrity of the child-objects. Furthermore, the
whole aggregate has only one identity visible to the outside: The
identity of the aggregate root object. Thus, objects outside of the
aggregate are only allowed to persistently reference the aggregate
root, and not one of the inner objects.

For the ``Car`` example this means that a
``ServiceStation`` object should not reference the engine
directly, but instead reference the ``Car`` through its
external identity. If it still needs access to the
engine, it can retrieve it through the ``Car``
object.

These referencing rules effectively structure the domain model
on a more fine-grained level, which reduces the complexity of the
application.

Life cycle of objects
---------------------

Objects in the real world have a certain life cycle. A car is
built, then it changes during its lifetime, and in the end it is
scrapped. In Domain-Driven Design, the life cycle of domain objects is
very similar:

.. _fig-lifecycle1:

.. figure:: Images/ddd-lifecycle1.png
	:class: screenshot-detail
	:alt: Simplified life cycle of objects

	Simplified life cycle of objects

Because of performance reasons, it is not feasible to keep all
objects in memory forever. Some kind of persistent storage, like a
database, is needed. Objects which are not needed at the current point
in time should be persistently stored, and only transformed into
objects when needed. Thus, we need to expand the ``active``
state from :ref:`fig-lifecycle1` to contain some more
substates. These are shown below:

.. figure:: Images/ddd-lifecycle2.png
	:class: screenshot-detail
	:alt: The real life cycle of objects

	The real life cycle of objects

If an object is newly created, it is
*transient*, so it is being deleted from memory at
the end of the current request. If an object is needed permanently
across requests, it needs to be transformed to a *persistent
object*. This is the responsibility of
*Repositories*, which allow to persistently store
and retrieve domain objects.

So, if an object is *added* to a repository,
this repository becomes responsible for saving the object.
Furthermore, it is also responsible for persisting further changes to
the object throughout its lifetime, automatically updating the
database as needed.

For retrieving objects, repositories provide a query language.
The repository automatically handles the database retrieval, and makes
sure that each entity is only once in memory.

Despite the object being created and retrieved multiple times
during its lifecycle, it logically continues to exist, even when it is
stored in the database. It is only because of performance and safety
reasons that is is not stored in main memory, but in a database. Thus,
Domain-Driven Design distinguishes *creation* of an
object from *reconstitution* from database: In the
first case, the constructor is called, in the second case the
constructor is not called as the object is only converted from another
representation form.

In order to remove a persistent object, it needs to be removed
from the repository responsible for it, and then at the end of the
request, the object is transparently removed from the database.

For each *aggregate*, there is exactly one
repository responsible which can be used to fetch the
*aggregate root* object.

How Flow enables Domain-Driven Design
-------------------------------------

Flow is a web development framework written in PHP, with
Domain-Driven Design as its core principle. We will now show in what
areas Flow supports Domain-Driven Design.

First, the developer can directly focus on creating the domain
model, using unit testing to implement the use-cases needed. While he
is creating the domain model, he can use plain PHP functionality,
without caring about any particular framework. The PHP domain model he
creates just consists of plain PHP objects, with no base class or
other magic functionality involved. Thus, he can fully concentrate on
domain modelling, without thinking about infrastructure yet.

This is a core principle of Flow: All parts of it strive for
maximum focus and cleanness of the domain model, keeping the developer
focused on the correct implementation of it.

Furthermore, the developer can use source code annotations to
attach metadata to classes, methods or properties. This functionality
can be used to mark objects as entity or value object, and to add
validation rules to properties. In the domain object below,
a sample of such an annotated class is given. As PHP does not have a
language construct for annotations, this is emulated by Flow by
parsing the source code comments.

In order to mark a domain object as *aggregate
root*, only a repository has to be created for it, based on
a certain naming convention. Repositories are the easiest way to make domain
objects persistent, and Flow provides a base class containing generic
``findBy*`` methods. Furthermore, it supports a
domain-specific language for building queries which can be used for
more complex queries, as shown in below in the ``AccountRepository``.

Now, this is all the developer needs to do in order to
persistently store domain objects. The database tables are created
automatically, and all objects get a UUID assigned (as we did not
specify an identity property).

A simple domain object being marked as entity, and validation::

	/**
	 * @Flow\Entity
	 */
	class Account {

		/**
		 * @var string
		 */
		protected $firstName;

		/**
		 * @var string
		 */
		protected $lastName;

		/**
		 * @var string
		 * @Flow\Validate(type="EmailAddress")
		 */
		protected $email;

		... getters and setters as well as other functions ...
	}

A simple repository::

	class AccountRepository extends \Neos\Flow\Persistence\Repository {

			// by extending from the base repository, there is automatically a
			// findBy* method available for every property, i.e. findByFirstName("Sebastian")
			// will return all accounts with the first name "Sebastian".
		public function findByName($firstName, $lastName) {
			$query = $this->createQuery();
			$query->matching(
				$query->logicalAnd(
					$query->equals('firstName', $firstName),
					$query->equals('lastName', $lastName)
				)
			);
			return $query->execute();
		}
	}

From the infrastructure perspective, Flow is structured as MVC
framework, with the model being the Domain-Driven Design techniques.
However, also in the controller and the view layer, the system has a
strong support for domain objects: It can transparently convert
objects to simple types, which can then be sent to the client's
browser. It also works the other way around: Simple types will be
converted to objects whenever possible, so the developer can deal with
objects in an end-to-end fashion.

Furthermore, Flow has an Aspect-Oriented Programming framework
at its core, which makes it easy to separate cross-cutting concerns.
There is a security framework in place (built upon AOP) where the
developer can declaratively define access rules for his domain
objects, and these are enforced automatically, without any checks
needed in the controller or the model.

There are a lot more features to show, like rapid prototyping
support, dependency injection, a signal-slots system and a
custom-built template engine, but all these should only aid the
developer in focusing on the problem domain and writing decoupled and
extensible code.
