Aspect-Oriented Programming
===========================

.. sectionauthor:: Robert Lemke <robert@neos.io>

Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) is a programming paradigm which complements
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) by separating *concerns* of a software
application to improve modularization. The separation of concerns (SoC) aims for
making a software easier to maintain by grouping features and behavior into
manageable parts which all have a specific purpose and business to take care of.

OOP already allows for modularizing concerns into distinct methods, classes and
packages. However, some concerns are difficult to place as they cross the
boundaries of classes and even packages. One example for such a *cross-cutting
concern* is security: Although the main purpose of a Forum package is to display
and manage posts of a forum, it has to implement some kind of security to assert
that only moderators can approve or delete posts. And many more packages need a
similar functionality for protect the creation, deletion and update of records.
AOP enables you to move the security (or any other) aspect into its own package
and leave the other objects with clear responsibilities, probably not
implementing any security themselves.

Aspect-Oriented Programming has been around in other programming languages for
quite some time now and sophisticated solutions taking advantage of AOP exist.
Flow's AOP framework allows you to use of the most popular AOP techniques in
your own PHP application. In contrast to other approaches it doesn't require any
special PHP extensions or manual compile steps – and it's a breeze to configure.

.. tip::
	In case you are unsure about some terms used in this introduction or later
	in this chapter, it's a good idea looking them up (for example at
	Wikipedia_). Don't think that you're the only one who has never heard of a
	*Pointcut* or *SoC* [#]_ – we had a hard time learning these too. However,
	it's worth the hassle, as a common vocabulary improves the communication
	between developers a lot.

How AOP can help you
====================

Let's imagine you want to log a message inside methods of your domain model:

*Example: Logging without AOP*::

	namespace Examples\Forum\Domain\Model;
	use Examples\Forum\Logger\ApplicationLoggerInterface;

	class Forum {

		/**
		 * @Flow\Inject
		 * @var ApplicationLoggerInterface
		 */
		protected $applicationLogger;

		/**
		 * Delete a forum post and log operation
		 */
		public function deletePost(Post $post): void
		{
			$this->applicationLogger->log('Removing post ' . $post->getTitle(), LOG_INFO);
			$this->posts->remove($post);
		}

	}

If you have to do this in a lot of places, the logging would become a part of you
domain model logic. You would have to inject all the logging dependencies in your
models. Since logging is nothing that a domain model should care about, this is
an example of a non-functional requirement and a so-called cross-cutting concern.

With AOP, the code inside your model would know nothing about logging. It will
just concentrate on the business logic.

*Example: Logging with AOP (your class)*::

	namespace Examples\Forum\Domain\Model;

	class Forum {

		/**
		 * Delete a forum post
		 */
		public function deletePost(Post $post): void
		{
			$this->posts->remove($post);
		}

	}

The	logging is now done from an AOP *aspect*. It's just a class tagged with
``@aspect`` and a method that implements the specific action, an
*before advice*. The expression after the ``@before`` tag tells the AOP framework
to which method calls this action should be applied. It's called *pointcut expression*
and has many possibilities, even for complex scenarios.

*Example: Logging with AOP (aspect)*::

	namespace Examples\Forum\Logging;
	use Examples\Forum\Logger\ApplicationLoggerInterface;
	use Neos\Flow\AOP\JoinPointInterface;

	/**
	 * @Flow\Aspect
	 */
	class LoggingAspect {

		/**
		 * @Flow\Inject
		 * @var ApplicationLoggerInterface
		 */
		protected $applicationLogger;

		/**
		 * Log a message if a post is deleted
		 *
		 * @Flow\Before("method(Examples\Forum\Domain\Model\Forum->deletePost())")
		 */
		public function logDeletePost(JoinPointInterface $joinPoint): void
		{
			$post = $joinPoint->getMethodArgument('post');
			$this->applicationLogger->log('Removing post ' . $post->getTitle(), LOG_INFO);
		}

	}

As you can see the advice has full access to the actual method call, the *join point*,
with information about the class, the method and method arguments.

AOP concepts and terminology
============================

At the first (and the second, third, ...) glance, the terms used in the AOP
context are not really intuitive. But, similar to most of the other AOP
frameworks, we better stick to them, to keep a common language between
developers. Here they are:

Aspect
	An aspect is the part of the application which cross-cuts the core concerns
	of multiple objects. In Flow, aspects are implemented as regular classes
	which are tagged by the ``@aspect`` annotation. The methods of an aspect class
	represent advices, the properties may be used for introductions.

Join point
	A join point is a point in the flow of a program. Examples are the execution
	of a method or the throw of an exception. In Flow, join points are
	represented by the ``Neos\Flow\AOP\JoinPoint`` object which contains more
	information about the circumstances like name of the called method, the
	passed arguments or type of the exception thrown. A join point is an event
	which occurs during the program flow, not a definition which defines that
	point.

Advice
	An advice is the action taken by an aspect at a particular join point.
	Advices are implemented as methods of the aspect class. These methods are
	executed before and / or after the join point is reached.

Pointcut
	The pointcut defines a set of join points which need to be matched before
	running an advice. The pointcut is configured by a *pointcut expression*
	which defines when and where an advice should be executed. Flow uses
	methods in an aspect class as anchors for pointcut declarations.

Pointcut expression
	A pointcut expression is the condition under which a join point should match.
	It may, for example, define that join points only match on the execution of a
	(target-) method with a certain name. Pointcut expressions are used in
	pointcut- and advice declarations.

Target
	A class or method being adviced by one or more aspects is referred to as a
	target class /-method.

Introduction
	An introduction redeclares the target class to implement an additional
	interface. By declaring an introduction it is possible to introduce new
	interfaces and an implementation of the required methods without touching
	the code of the original class. Additionally introductions can be used to
	add new properties to a target class.

The following terms are related to advices:

Before advice
	A before advice is executed before the target method is being called, but
	cannot prevent the target method from being executed.

After returning advice
	An after returning advice is executed after returning from the target
	method. The result of the target method invocation is available to the after
	returning advice, but it can't change it. If the target method throws an
	exception, the after returning advice is not executed.

After throwing advice
	An after throwing advice is only executed if the target method throwed an
	exception. The after throwing advice may fetch the exception type from the
	join point object.

After advice
	An after advice is executed after the target method has been called, no
	matter if an exception was thrown or not.

Around advice
	An around advice is wrapped around the execution of the target method. It
	may execute code before and after the invocation of the target method and
	may ultimately prevent the original method from being executed at all. An
	around advice is also responsible for calling other around advices at the
	same join point and returning either the original or a modified result for
	the target method.

Advice chain
	If more than one around advice exists for a join point, they are called in
	an onion-like advice chain: The first around advice probably executes some
	before-code, then calls the second around advice which calls the target
	method. The target method returns a result which can be modified by the
	second around advice, is returned to the first around advice which finally
	returns the result to the initiator of the method call. Any around advice
	may decide to proceed or break the chain and modify results if necessary.

Flow AOP concepts
-----------------

Aspect-Oriented Programming was, of course, not invented by us [#]_. Since the
initial release of the concept, dozens of implementations for various
programming languages evolved. Although a few PHP-based AOP frameworks do exist,
they followed concepts which did not match the goals of Flow (to provide a
powerful, yet developer-friendly solution) when the development of Neos
began. We therefore decided to create a sophisticated but pragmatic
implementation which adopts the concepts of AOP but takes PHP's specialties and
the requirements of typical Flow applications into account. In a few cases this
even lead to new features or simplifications because they were easier to
implement in PHP compared to Java.

Flow pragmatically implements a reduced subset of AOP, which satisfies most
needs of web applications. The join point model allows for intercepting method
executions but provides no special support for advising field access [#]_.
Pointcut expressions are based on well-known regular expressions instead of
requiring the knowledge of a dedicated expression language. Pointcut filters and
join point types are modularized and can be extended if more advanced
requirements should arise in the future.

Implementation overview
=======================

Flow's AOP framework does not require a pre-processor or an aspect-aware PHP
interpreter to weave in advices. It is implemented and based on pure PHP and
doesn't need any specific PHP extension. However, it does require the Object
Manager to fulfill its task.

Flow uses PHP's reflection capabilities to analyze declarations of aspects,
pointcuts and advices and implements method interceptors as a dynamic proxy. In
accordance to the GoF patterns [#]_, the proxy classes act as a placeholders for
the target object. They are true subclasses of the original and override adviced
methods by implementing an interceptor method. The proxy classes are generated
automatically by the AOP framework and cached for further use. If a class has
been adviced by some aspect, the Object Manager will only deliver instances of
the proxy class instead of the original.

The approach of storing generated proxy classes in files provides the whole
advantage of dynamic weaving with a minimum performance hit. Debugging of
proxied classes is still easy as they truly exist in real files.

Aspects
=======

Aspects are abstract containers which accommodate pointcut-, introduction- and
advice declarations. In most frameworks, including Flow, aspects are defined as
plain classes which are tagged (annotated) as an aspect. The following example
shows the definition of a hypothetical ``FooSecurity`` aspect:

*Example: Declaration of an aspect*::

	namespace Example\MySecurityPackage;

	/**
	 * An aspect implementing security for Foo
	 *
	 * @Flow\Aspect
	 */
	class FooSecurityAspect {

	}

As you can see, ``\Example\MySecurityPackage\FooSecurityAspect`` is just a regular
PHP class which may (actually must) contain methods and properties. What
makes it an aspect is solely the ``Aspect`` annotation mentioned in the class
comment. The AOP framework recognizes this tag and registers the class as an
aspect.

.. Note::
	A void aspect class doesn't make any sense and if you try to run the above
	example, the AOP framework will throw an exception complaining that no
	advice, introduction or pointcut has been defined.

.. Note::
	With Flow classes that are marked ``final`` can be targeted by AOP advices
	by default.
	This can be explicitly disabled with a ``@Flow\Proxy(false)`` annotation on the
	class in question.

Pointcuts
=========

If we want to add security to foo, we need a method which carries out the
security checks and a definition where and when this method should be executed.
The method is an advice which we're going to declare in a later section, the
“where and when” is defined by a pointcut expression in a pointcut declaration.

You can either define the pointcut in the advice declaration or set up named
pointcuts to help clarify their use.

A named pointcut is represented by a method of an aspect class. It contains
two pieces of information: The pointcut name, defined by the method name,
and the pointcut expression, declared by an annotation. The following pointcut
will match the execution of methods whose name starts with “delete”, no matter
in which class they are defined:

*Example: Declaration of a named pointcut*::

	/**
	 * A pointcut which matches all methods whose name starts with "delete".
	 *
	 * @Flow\Pointcut("method(.*->delete.*())")
	 */
	public function deleteMethods() {}

Pointcut expressions
--------------------

As already mentioned, the pointcut expression configures the filters which are
used to match against join points. It is comparable to an if condition in PHP:
Only if the whole condition evaluates to true, the statement is executed -
otherwise it will be just ignored. If a pointcut expression evaluates to true,
the pointcut matches and advices which refer to this pointcut become active.

.. Note::
	The AOP framework AspectJ provides a complete pointcut language with dozens
	of pointcut types and expression constructs. Flow makes do with only a
	small subset of that language, which we think already suffice for even
	complex enterprise applications. If you're interested in the original
	feature set, it doesn't hurt throwing a glance at the AspectJ Programming
	Guide.

Pointcut designators
--------------------

A pointcut expression always consists of two parts: The poincut designator and
its parameter(s). The following designators are supported by Flow:

method()
^^^^^^^^

The ``method()`` designator matches on the execution of methods with a certain
name. The parameter specifies the class and method name, regular expressions
can be used for more flexibility [#]_. It follows the following scheme::

	method([public|protected] ClassName->methodName())

Specifying the visibility modifier (public or protected) is optional - if none
is specified, both visibilities will match. The class- and method name can be
specified as a regular expression.

.. warning:: It is not possible to match for *interfaces* within the ``method()``
   pointcut expression. Instead of ``method(InterfaceName->methodName())``, use
   ``within(InterfaceName) && method(.*->methodName())``.

Here are some examples for matching method executions:

*Example: method() pointcut designator*

-----

Matches all public methods in class ``Example\MyPackage\MyObject``:

``method(public Example\MyPackage\MyObject->.*())``

Matches all methods prefixed with "delete" (even protected ones) in
any class of the package ``Example.MyPackage``:

``method(Example\MyPackage.*->delete.*())``

Matches all methods except injectors in class ``Example\MyPackage\MyObject``:

``method(Example\MyPackage\MyObject->(?!inject).*())``

-----

.. Note::
	In other AOP frameworks, including AspectJ™ and Spring™, the method
	designator does not exist. They rather use a more fine grained approach
	with designators such as execution, call and cflow. As Flow only supports
	matching to method execution join points anyway, we decided to simplify
	things by allowing only a more general method designator.

The ``method()`` designator also supports so called runtime evaluations,
meaning you can specify values for the method's arguments. If those argument
values do not match the advice won't be executed. The following example should
give you an idea how this works:

*Example: Runtime evaluations for the method() pointcut designator*

-----

``method(Example\MyPackage\MyClass->update(title == "Flow", override == true))``

-----

Besides the method arguments you can also access the properties of the current
object or a global object like the party that is currently authenticated.
A detailed description of the runtime evaluations possibilities is described
below in the section about the ``evaluate()`` pointcut designator.

class()
^^^^^^^

The ``class()`` designator matches on the execution of methods defined in a
class with a certain name. The parameter specifies the class name, again
regular expressions are allowed here. The ``class()`` designator follows this
simple scheme:

``class(classname)``

*Example: class() pointcut designator*

-----

Matches all methods in class ``Example\MyPackage\MyObject``:

``class(Example\MyPackage\MyObject)``

Matches all methods in namespace "Service":

``class(Example\MyPackage\Service\.*)``

.. warning:: The ``class`` pointcut expression does not match interfaces. If
   you want to match interfaces, use ``within()`` instead.

-----

within()
^^^^^^^^

The ``within()`` designator matches on the execution of methods defined in a
class of a certain type. A type matches if the class is a subclass of or
implements an interface of the given name. The ``within()`` designator has this
simple syntax:

``within(type)``

*Example: within() pointcut designator*

-----

Matches all methods in classes which implement the logger interface:

``within(Example\Flow\Log\LoggerInterface)``

Matches all methods in classes which are part of the Foo layer:

``within(Example\Flow\FooLayerInterface)``

------

.. Note::
	``within()`` will not match on specific nesting in the call stack,
	even when the name might imply this. It's just a more generic class
	designator matching whole type hierarchies.

classAnnotatedWith()
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``classAnnotatedWith()`` designator matches on classes which are tagged with a
certain annotation. Currently only the actual annotation class name can be matched,
arguments of the annotation cannot be specified:

``classAnnotatedWith(annotation)``

*Example: classAnnotatedWith() pointcut designator*

-----

Matches all classes which are tagged with Flow's ``Entity`` annotation:

``classAnnotatedWith(Neos\Flow\Annotations\Entity)``

Matches all classes which are tagged with a custom annotation:

``classAnnotatedWith(Acme\Demo\Annotations\Important)``

-----

methodAnnotatedWith()
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``methodAnnotatedWith()`` designator matches on methods which are annotated
with a certain annotation.  Currently only the actual annotation class name can be
matched, arguments of the annotation cannot be specified. The syntax of this
designator is as follows:

``methodAnnotatedWith(annotation)``

*Example: methodAnnotatedWith() pointcut designator*

-----

Matches all method which are annotated with a ``Special`` annotation:

``methodAnnotatedWith(Acme\Demo\Annotations\Special)``

-----

setting()
^^^^^^^^^

The setting() designator matches if the given configuration option is set to
true, or if an optional given comparison value equals to its configured value.
This is helpful to make advices configurable and switch them off in a
specific Flow context or just for testing. You can use this designator
as follows:

*Example: setting() pointcut designator*

-----

Matches if "my.configuration.option" is set to true in the current execution
context:

``setting(my.configuration.option)``

Matches if "my.configuration.option" is equal to "AOP is cool" in the current
execution context: (Note: single and double quotes are allowed)

``setting(my.configuration.option = 'AOP is cool')``

-----

evaluate()
^^^^^^^^^^

The ``evaluate()`` designator is used to execute advices depending on constraints
that have to be evaluated during runtime. This could be a specific value for a
method argument (see the ``method()`` designator) or checking a certain property of
the current object or accessing a global object like the currently
authenticated party. In general you can access object properties by
the ``.`` syntax and global objects are registered under the ``current.`` keyword. Here
is an example showing the possibilities:

*Example: evaluate() pointcut designator*

-----

Matches if the property name of the global party object (the currently
authenticated user of the security framework) is equal to "Andi":

``evaluate(current.userService.currentUser.name == "Andi")``

Matches if the property someProperty of someObject which is a property of the
current object (the object the advice will be executed in) is equal to the
name of the currently authenticated user:

``evaluate(this.someObject.someProperty == current.userService.currentUser.name)``

Matches if the property someProperty of the current object is equal to one of
the values true, "someString" or the address of the currently authenticated user:

``evaluate(this.someProperty in (true, "someString", current.userService.currentUser.address))``

Matches if the accounts array in the current party object contains the account
stored in the myAccount property of the current object:

``evaluate(current.userService.currentUser.accounts contains this.myAccount)``

Matches if at least one of the entries in the first array exists in the second one:

``evaluate(current.userService.currentUser.accounts matches ('Administrator', 'Customer', 'User'))``

``evaluate(current.userService.currentUser.accounts matches this.accounts)``

------

.. tip::
	If you like you can enter more than one constraint in a single evaluate
	pointcut designator by separating them with a comma. The evaluate
	designator will only match, if all its conditions evaluated to true.

.. note::
	It is possible to register arbitrary singletons to be available as global
	objects with the Flow configuration setting ``Neos.Flow.aop.globalObjects``.

filter()
^^^^^^^^

If the built-in filters don't suit your needs you can even define your own
custom filters. All you need to do is create a class implementing the
``Neos\Flow\AOP\Pointcut\PointcutFilterInterface`` and develop your own logic
for the ``matches()`` method. The custom filter can then be invoked by using
the ``filter()`` designator:

``filter(CustomFilterObjectName)``

*Example: filter() pointcut designator*

-----

If the current method matches is determined by the custom filter:

``filter(Example\MyPackage\MyCustomPointcutFilter)``

-----


Combining pointcut expressions
------------------------------

All pointcut expressions mentioned in previous sections can be combined into
a whole expression, just like you may combine parts to an overall condition in
an if construct. The supported operators are “&&”, “||” and “!” and they have
the same meaning as in PHP. Nesting expressions with parentheses is not
supported but you may refer to other pointcuts by specifying their full name
(i.e. class- and method name). This final example shows how to combine and
reuse pointcuts and ultimately build a hierarchy of pointcuts which can be used
conveniently in advice declarations:

*Example: Combining pointcut expressions*::

	namespace Example\TestPackage;

	/**
	 * Fixture class for testing pointcut definitions
	 *
	 * @Flow\Aspect
	 */
	class PointcutTestingAspect
	{

		/**
		 * Pointcut which includes all method executions in
		 * PointcutTestingTargetClasses except those from Target
		 * Class number 3.
		 *
		 * @Flow\Pointcut("method(Example\TestPackage\PointcutTestingTargetClass.*->.*()) && !method(Example\TestPackage\PointcutTestingTargetClass3->.*())")
		 */
		public function pointcutTestingTargetClasses(): void {}

		/**
		 * Pointcut which consists of only the
		 * Example\TestPackage\OtherPointcutTestingTargetClass.
		 *
		 * @Flow\Pointcut("method(Example\TestPackage\OtherPointcutTestingTargetClass->.*())")
		 */
		public function otherPointcutTestingTargetClass(): void {}

		/**
		 * A combination of both above pointcuts
		 *
		 * @Flow\Pointcut("Example\TestPackage\PointcutTestingAspect->pointcutTestingTargetClasses || Example\TestPackage\PointcutTestingAspect->otherPointcutTestingTargetClass")
		 */
		public function bothPointcuts(): void {}

		/**
		 * A pointcut which matches all classes from the service layer
		 *
		 * @Flow\Pointcut("within(Example\Flow\ServiceLayerInterface)")
		 */
		public function serviceLayerClasses(): void {}

		/**
		 * A pointcut which matches any method from the BasicClass and all classes
		 * from the service layer
		 *
		 * @Flow\Pointcut("method(Example\TestPackage\Basic.*->.*()) || within(Neos\Flow\Service.*)")
		 */
		public function basicClassOrServiceLayerClasses(): void {}
	}

Declaring advice
================

With the aspect and pointcuts in place we are now ready to declare the advice.
Remember that an advice is the actual action, the implementation of the concern
you want to weave in to some target. Advices are implemented as interceptors
which may run before and / or after the target method is called. Four advice
types allow for these different kinds of interception: Before, After returning,
After throwing and Around.

Other than being of a certain type, advices always come with a pointcut
expression which defines the set of join points the advice applies for.
The pointcut expression may, as we have seen earlier, refer to other
named pointcuts.

Before advice
-------------

A before advice allows for executing code before the target method is invoked.
However, the advice cannot prevent the target method from being executed, nor
can it take influence on other before advices at the same join point.

*Example: Declaration of a before advice*::

	/**
	 * Before advice which is invoked before any method call within the News
	 * package
	 *
	 * @Flow\Before("class(Example\News\.*->.*())")
	 */
	public function myBeforeAdvice(\Neos\Flow\AOP\JoinPointInterface $joinPoint): void
	{
	}


After returning advice
----------------------

The after returning advice becomes active after the target method normally
returns from execution (i.e. it doesn't throw an exception). After returning
advices may read the result of the target method, but can't modify it.

*Example: Declaration of an after returning advice*::

	/**
	 * After returning advice
	 *
	 * @Flow\AfterReturning("method(public Example\News\FeedAgregator->[import|update].*()) || Example\MyPackage\MyAspect->someOtherPointcut")
	 */
	public function myAfterReturningAdvice(\Neos\Flow\AOP\JoinPointInterface $joinPoint): void
	{
	}


After throwing advice
---------------------

Similar to the “after returning” advice, the after throwing advice is invoked
after method execution, but only if an exception was thrown.

*Example: Declaration of an after throwing advice*::

	/**
	 * After throwing advice
	 *
	 * @Flow\AfterThrowing("within(Example\News\ImportantLayer)")
	 */
	public function myAfterThrowingAdvice(\Neos\Flow\AOP\JoinPointInterface $joinPoint): void
	{
	}


After advice
------------

The after advice is a combination of “after returning” and “after throwing”:
These advices become active after method execution, no matter if an exception
was thrown or not.

*Example: Declaration of an after advice*::

	/**
	 * After advice
	 *
	 * @Flow\After("Example\MyPackage\MyAspect->justAPointcut")
	 */
	public function myAfterAdvice(\Neos\Flow\AOP\JoinPointInterface $joinPoint): void
	{
	}


Around advice
-------------

Finally, the around advice takes total control over the target method and
intercepts it completely. It may decide to call the original method or not and
even modify the result of the target method or return a completely
different one. Obviously the around advice is the most powerful and should only
be used if the concern can't be implemented with the alternative advice types.
You might already guess how an around advice is declared:

*Example: Declaration of an around advice*::

	/**
	 * Around advice
	 *
	 * @Flow\Around("Example\MyPackage\MyAspect->justAPointcut")
	 */
	public function myAroundAdvice(\Neos\Flow\AOP\JoinPointInterface $joinPoint): void
	{
	}


Implementing advice
===================

The final step after declaring aspects, pointcuts and advices is to fill the
advices with life. The implementation of an advice is located in the same
method it has been declared. In that regard, an aspect class behaves like any
other object in Flow – you therefore can take advantage of dependency
injection in case you need other objects to fulfill the task of your advice.

Accessing join points
---------------------

As you have seen in the previous section, advice methods always expect an
argument of the type ``Neos\Flow\AOP\JoinPointInterface``. This join point object
contains all important information about the current join point. Methods like
getClassName() or getMethodArguments() let the advice method classify the
current context and enable you to implement advices in a way that they can be
reused in different situations. For a full description of the join point object
refer to the API documentation.

Advice chains
-------------

Around advices are a special advice type in that they have the power to
completely intercept the target method. For any other advice type, the advice
methods are called by the proxy class one after another. In case of the around
advice, the methods form a chain where each link is responsible to pass over
control to the next.

	Control flow of an advice chain

Examples
--------

Let's put our knowledge into practice and start with a simple example. First we
would like to log each access to methods within a certain package. The following
code will just do that:

*Example: Simple logging with aspects*::

	namespace Example\MyPackage;
	use Neos\Flow\AOP\JoinPointInterface;
	use Psr\Log\LoggerInterface;

	/**
	 * A logging aspect
	 *
	 * @Flow\Aspect
	 */
	class LoggingAspect
	{

		/**
		 * @var LoggerInterface A logger implementation
		 */
		protected $logger;

		/**
		 * For logging we need a logger, which we will get injected automatically by
		 * the Object Manager
		 */
		public function injectLogger(LoggerInterface $logger): void
		{
			$this->logger = $logger;
		}

		/**
		 * Before advice, logs all access to public methods of our package
		 *
		 * @Flow\Before("method(public Example\MyPackage\.*->.*())")
		 */
		public function logMethodExecution(JoinPointInterface $joinPoint): void
		{
			$logMessage = 'The method ' . $joinPoint->getMethodName() . ' in class ' .
				$joinPoint->getClassName() . ' has been called.';
			$this->logger->info($logMessage);
		}
	}


Note that we are using dependency injection for getting the system logger
instance to stay independent from any specific logging implementation. We don't
have to care about the kind of logger and where it comes from.

Finally an example for the implementation of an around advice: For a guest
book, we want to reject the last name “Sarkosh” (because it should be
“Skårhøj”), every time it is submitted. Admittedly you probably wouldn't
implement this great feature as an aspect, but it's easy enough to demonstrate
the idea. For illustration purposes, we don't define the pointcut expression in
place but refer to a named pointcut.

*Example: Implementation of an around advice*::

	namespace Example\Guestbook;
	use Neos\Flow\AOP\JoinPointInterface;

	/**
	 * A lastname rejection aspect
	 *
	 * @Flow\Aspect
	 */
	class LastNameRejectionAspect
	{

		/**
		 * A pointcut which matches all guestbook submission method invocations
		 *
		 * @Flow\Pointcut("method(Example\Guestbook\SubmissionHandlingThingy->submit())")
		 */
		public function guestbookSubmissionPointcut(): void {}

		/**
		 * Around advice, rejects the last name "Sarkosh"
		 *
		 * @return mixed Result of the target method
		 * @Flow\Around("Example\Guestbook\LastNameRejectionAspect->guestbookSubmissionPointcut")
		 */
		public function rejectLastName(JoinPointInterface $joinPoint)
		{
			if ($joinPoint->getMethodArgument('lastName') === 'Sarkosh') {
				throw new \Exception('Sarkosh is not a valid last name - should be Skårhøj!');
			}
			$result = $joinPoint->getAdviceChain()->proceed($joinPoint);
			return $result;
		}
	}


Please note that if the last name is correct, we proceed with the remaining
links in the advice chain. This is very important to assure that the original
(target-) method is finally called. And don't forget to return the result of
the advice chain ...

Introductions
=============

Introductions (also known as Inter-type Declarations) allow to subsequently
implement an interface or new properties in a given target class.
The (usually) newly introduced methods (required by the new interface) can
then be implemented by declaring an advice. If no implementation is defined,
an empty placeholder method will be generated automatically to satisfy
the contract of the introduced interface.

Interface introduction
-----------------------

Like advices, introductions are declared by annotations. But in contrast to
advices, the anchor for an introduction declaration is the class declaration of
the aspect class. The annotation tag follows this syntax:

``@Flow\Introduce("PointcutExpression", interfaceName="NewInterfaceName")``

Although the PointcutExpression is just a normal pointcut expression, which may
also refer to named pointcuts, be aware that only expressions filtering for
classes make sense. You cannot use the method() pointcut designator in this
context and will typically take the class() designator instead.

The following example introduces a new interface ``NewInterface`` to the class
``OldClass`` and also provides an implementation of the method ``newMethod``.

*Example: Interface introduction*::

    namespace Example\MyPackage;
    use Neos\Flow\AOP\JoinPointInterface;

    /**
     * An aspect for demonstrating introductions
     *
     * Introduces Example\MyPackage\NewInterface to the class Example\MyPackage\OldClass:
     *
     * @Flow\Introduce("class(Example\MyPackage\OldClass)", interfaceName="Example\MyPackage\NewInterface")
     * @Flow\Aspect
     */
    class IntroductionAspect
    {
        /**
         * Around advice, implements the new method "newMethod" of the
         * "NewInterface" interface
         *
         * @Flow\Around("method(Example\MyPackage\OldClass->newMethod())")
         */
        public function newMethodImplementation(JoinPointInterface $joinPoint): int
        {
                // We call the advice chain, in case any other advice is declared for
                // this method, but we don't care about the result.
            $someResult = $joinPoint->getAdviceChain()->proceed($joinPoint);

            $a = $joinPoint->getMethodArgument('a');
            $b = $joinPoint->getMethodArgument('b');
            return $a + $b;
        }
    }

Trait introduction
-------------------

Like the interface introductions, also trait introductions are declared
by annotation. It even uses the same annotation with a different argument:

``@Flow\Introduce("PointcutExpression", traitName="NewTraitName")``

Again only pointcuts filtering for classes make sense. The traitName must
be a fully qualified "class" (trait) name without leading backslash.

The following example introduces a trait ``SomeTrait`` to the class ``MyClass``.

*Example: Trait introduction*::

    namespace Example\MyPackage;

    use Neos\Flow\Annotations as Flow;

    /**
     * An aspect for demonstrating trait introduction
     *
     * Introduces Example\MyPackage\SomeTrait to the class Example\MyPackage\MyClass:
     *
     * @Flow\Introduce("class(Example\MyPackage\MyClass)", traitName="Example\MyPackage\SomeTrait")
     * @Flow\Aspect
     */
    class TraitIntroductionAspect
    {
    }

Property introduction
-----------------------

The declaration of a property introduction anchors to a property inside an aspect.

Form of the declaration::

    /**
     * @var type
     * @Flow\Introduce("PointcutExpression")
     */
    protected $propertyName;

The declared property will be added to the target classes matched by the pointcut.

The following example introduces a new property "subtitle" to the class
``Example\Blog\Domain\Model\Post``:

*Example: Property introduction*::

    namespace Example\MyPackage;

    use Neos\Flow\Annotations as Flow;

    /**
     * An aspect for demonstrating property introductions
     *
     * @Flow\Aspect
     */
    class PropertyIntroductionAspect
    {

        /**
         * @var string
         * @Doctrine\ORM\Mapping\Column(length=40)
         * @Flow\Introduce("class(Example\Blog\Domain\Model\Post)")
         */
        protected $subtitle;
    }

.. note::
    Any annotation on the introduced property (except the actual ``Introduce``)
    **must use the fully qualified class name** for Flow to build working proxy
    class code.

Implementation details
======================

AOP proxy mechanism
-------------------

The following diagram illustrates the building process of a proxy class:

	Proxy building process

------

.. [#] SoC could, by the way, also mean “Self-organized criticality” or
	“Service-oriented Computing” or refer to Google's “Summer of Code” ...
.. [#] AOP was rather invented by Gregor Kiczalesand his team at the Xerox Palo
	Alto Research Center. The original implementation was called AspectJ and is
	an extension to Java. It still serves as a de-facto standard and is now
	maintained by the Eclipse Foundation.
.. [#] Intercepting setting and retrieval of properties can easily be achieved
	by declaring a before-, after- or around advice.
.. [#] GoF means Gang of Four and refers to the authors of the classic book
	*Design Patterns – Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software*
.. [#] Internally, PHP's ``preg_match()`` function is used to match the method
	name. The regular expression will be enclosed by /^...$/ (without the dots
	of course). Backslashes will be escaped to make namespace use possible
	without further hassle.
