`BUGFIX: Handle configuration value "false" for trusted proxies <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/1746>`_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This fixes the case when a configured environment variable (like the default `FLOW_HTTP_TRUSTEDPROXIES`) is not set, in which case the value will be `false`.

`BUGFIX: Make ScriptsMock::buildSubprocessCommand signature match parent <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/1742>`_
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This prevents a Warning notice in Unit Tests.

`BUGFIX: Allow a single '*' entry in trustedProxies <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/1683>`_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This makes the setting `Neos.Flow.http.trustedProxies.proxies` behave equal for a setting of
`"*"` or `["*"]` or `- "*"`.

Also, the static class does not need to be mocked with PHPUnit, as PHPUnit can not stub static methods anyway.

`BUGFIX: Do not join select property paths to embedded objects <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/1404>`_
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Instead of assuming that every property path with a dot is a path
to an other entity check if the property path is a mapped field which
is also true for embedded object properties.

Resolves #989

**What I did**
We'll i suppose i fixed it :sweat_smile: 

**How I did it**
I searched the existing class schema for hints about embedded properties and found it in the entityManager. When the path exists in the fieldMappings it is a field embedded in the object's table. Since we're using doctrine in this kind of query anyway i think we're safe to go whit this solution.

**How to verify it**
The description of the original bug should be suffice.

`TASK: Use var_dump return parameter <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/1686>`_
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**What I did**
When digging through the code I found this instance of capturing the output of `\\Neos\\Flow\\var_dump` using `ob_get_contents` when `\\Neos\\Flow\\var_dump` has a `$return` parameter itself.

**How I did it**
Using the `$return` parameter of `\\Neos\\Flow\\var_dump`

`BUGFIX: Avoid unsupported operand types error <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/1674>`_
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Under some circumstances, the session metadata cache might iterate a non-array value and the following logging attempt failing with an unsupported operand type error for the `+` array concatenation. This change works around this error, by checking the `$sessionInfo` to be of type array and assigning a wrapper array otherwise.

* Packages: ``Flow``

`TASK: Make array indexing difference more visible <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/1675>`_
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Previously, if an array was expected but a non numerically indexed array (i.e. a "dictionary") was given, the error message would output `expected: type=array found: type=array`, which is totally confusing.

`BUGFIX: Authentication: Only intercept GET requests <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/1695>`_
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Adjusts the `Dispatcher` so that it only intercepts GET
requests in order to prevent unwanted side effects when
redirecting to an unsafe request.

`BUGFIX: Respect Neos.Flow.http.baseUri path in UriBuilder <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/1682>`_
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If Neos.Flow.http.baseUri contains a path, it was not respected
during uri building.

See: #1185
Resolves: #1215

**What I did**
Add path of `Neos.Flow.http.baseUri` to ResolveContext's uriPathPrefix.

**How to verify it**
Configure `Neos.Flow.http.baseUri` to be an absolute URI with path, build URI to any Controller.

<!--
Thanks for your contribution, we appreciate it!

https://discuss.neos.io/t/creating-a-pull-request/506

And one more thing... Don't forget about the tests!
-->



**What I did**

Add support for using a fallback to verify whether the `PHP_BINARY` for the currently configured PHP binary file matches the one being used currently.

The current logic only resolves the symlink, which may not always work, e.g. what if the `php` binary is being executed through a wrapper like this?

    #!/bin/sh
    . /path/to/setenv.sh
    exec /path/to/php.bin "$@"

(Where `php.bin` is the binary file and `setenv.sh` a script with sets environment variables - Wrappers like these are heavily used in Bitnami installations.)

**How I did it**

Before Flow compares which PHP binary is being used (and which it is supposedly configured to use), we run a PHP `exec` to print `PHP_BINARY`.

Then, we store the result and if no errors were thrown, use this as the detected PHP binary path to compare with. If any errors were detected (via the "exec" exit code), we use the original logic that resolves any symlink it's pointing to.

If it matches the existing one, it means everything went great, if not an error will be thrown like before.

**How to verify it**

- A correct PHP wrapper pointing to the PHP binary (e.g. php.bin) is allowed for being used for CLI subrequests (method `ensureCLISubrequestsUseCurrentlyRunningPhpBinary`).
- An invalid PHP wrapper fails when being used for CLI subrequests (method `ensureCLISubrequestsUseCurrentlyRunningPhpBinary`).

**Checklist**

- [x] Code follows the PSR-2 coding style - Checked
- [x] Tests have been created, run and adjusted as needed - Couldn't find any tests for this part
- [x] The PR is created against the [lowest maintained branch](https://www.neos.io/features/release-roadmap.html) - Using 4.3 branch

`TASK: Update documentation about AbstractConditionViewHelper. <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/1677>`_
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I tried to create a custom IfViewHelper by extending the AbstractConditionViewHelper and noticed that it was still mentioning to overwrite the render function.
However the render function is not called but rather the evaluateCondition function must be overwritten.
I've basically taken the documentation from the Neos docs and copied it here and made some adjustments.

Let me know if this is ok or not (but current state of the documentation is not correct so it should be changed).

Fluid 2.6 introduced another change to the AbstractConditionViewHelper that can be found here: https://github.com/TYPO3/Fluid/commit/`a67b31f9e6ecb015d0f47892fce46cf64110fd15 <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/commit/a67b31f9e6ecb015d0f47892fce46cf64110fd15>`_

With Fluid 3.0 the evaluateCondition function won't be used anymore - should be kept in mind.

Thanks,
David

`BUGFIX: Omit sessionless tokens from session <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/1662>`_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Without this fix, all security tokens â€“ including those which are
implementations of SessionlessTokenInterface â€“ are serialized and
added to the current session. This is a problem for sessionless
tokens, which need to be updated on every request on not just once
per session.

`TASK: Loosen typo3 fluid dependency <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/1638>`_
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This allows to install any version of TYPO3 Fluid >= 2.1.3, < 2.5.0 instead of the previously limiting to ~2.1.3
Since Flow 5.0+ requires TYPO3 Fluid 2.5.x, this is consistent.
