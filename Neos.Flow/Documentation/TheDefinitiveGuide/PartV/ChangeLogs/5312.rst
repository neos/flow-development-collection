`TASK: Fix validation warnings/errors on .travis.yml <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/1908>`_
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fixes build config validation complaints:

- W notifications.slack: unknown key on_start (never)
- I root: missing os, using the default linux
- I root: key matrix is an alias for jobs, using jobs

`BUGFIX: Make sure to use only a consistent DatesReaderCache <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/1899>`_
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It might happen that there is a discrepancy between parsedFormatsIndices and parsedFormats cache. We need to make sure we are accessing the consistent information instead of relying that both are there, to avoid a PHP exception.

Resolves #564 

The problem described in #564 is not easy to reproduce, as it only happens "once in a while" in production. See issue comments for further information.

`BUGFIX: Fix error handling for importing resources <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/1888>`_

While working with `ResourceManager` I noticed that importing non-existent resources would fail later in the process than expected: They would only fail when trying to copy the temporary file to it's persistent location instead of failing when fetching the original file.

**What I did**
This PR fixes the incorrect error handling of fetching files when importing resources.

**How I did it**
The code assumed that `copy` would throw an exception if it failed - however, it returns `false` in that case.

**How to verify it**
Try to import a non-existent resource (e.g. http://example.com/this-file-does-not-exist). It should now correctly throw the `Could not copy the file from "..." to temporary file "..."` exception  from `WritableFileSystemStorage::importResource` instead of the much later `The temporary file of the file import could not be moved to the final target "..."` from `WritableFileSystemStorage::moveTemporaryFileToFinalDestination`
