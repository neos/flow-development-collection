`!!! FEATURE: Extensible configuration loaders <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/2449>`_
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This PR allows to implement custom ConfigurationLoader classes which replace the currently rather hardcoded ConfigurationProcessor's in an OOP way.

It is then possible to load custom configurations in the ConfigurationManager with custom locations and custom configuration formats. E.g. it is possible to load json files or NodeTypes from another directory than ``Configuration``.

This is not a breaking change for most cases, but the signature of ``ConfigurationManager::registerConfigurationType()`` has been changed and the usage of "configurationProcessingTypes" deprecated in favor of ``Neos\\Flow\\Configuration\\Loader\\LoaderInterface`` instances::

  // legacy (and still supported)
  $configurationManager->registerConfigurationType('SomeCustom', ConfigurationManager::CONFIGURATION_PROCESSING_TYPE_APPEND);

  // now
  $configurationManager->registerConfigurationType('SomeCustom', new AppendLoader($yamlSource, 'SomeCustom'));

`FEATURE: Preserve class and method doc blocks <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/2533>`_
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This preserves the docblocks when generating proxies in order to not accidentially generate invalid annotations that break the classes.

`FEATURE: Allow validation of dynamic argument types <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/1906>`_
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This allows correct validation of action method arguments that are not
statically typed, e.g. have a type hint of an interface.
The type override via ``__type`` or the property mapping configuration will
now take effect for building the correct validator chain, if the controller has
the property ``$enableDynamicTypeValidation`` set to ``true``.

If you enable this flag, note that the point in time when the validation
chain is built is moved until **after** calling the ``initialize*Action`` method.
This means that validator information is not available there any more.

`FEATURE: CLI parse array type controller arguments <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/2519>`_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With this PR, a CLI command can make use of array's as an argument type.

If an argument is given multiple times and the type is an array, the argument values are pushed at the end of the array.

As an example, this can be handy, if you need to process multiple language dimensions, nodes or urls, like::

  ./flow my.pckg:index --dimension en --dimension de

Maybe this can also be considered for the 7.2 release?

The CLI ``RequestBuilder`` now distinguishes between array and non-array arguments. If an argument is of type ``array`` the argumentValue is appended to the array.

Create a command controller command with an array signature like::

  public function indexCommand(array $dimension){

and then use the argument ``--dimension`` multiple times.

`FEATURE: Support PHP8 attributes <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/2468>`_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This allows to use all existing Annotations as PHP8 Attributes and makes the ReflectionService pick up attributes like annotations.
Hence all ``is*AnnotatedWith()`` and ``*Annotation()`` methods will return attribute classes as if they were annotations.

.. code-block:: php
 #[Flow\\Scope("singleton")]
 class MyClass {

     /**
      * @var LoggerInterface
      */
     #[Flow\\Inject]
    protected $logger;


Note though, that this means a class that has both annotation and the equal attribute will behave as if all annotations were duplicated.

Also, in case you manually instanciated an Annotation class, you need to adjust to the changed constructor, which no longer takes a named array, but the list of actual properties.

In most cases instead of ``new Flow\\Inject($args)`` you can probably do ``new Flow\\Inject(...$args)`` with PHP8 and named parameters.

For Doctrine Annotations - see https://github.com/doctrine/orm/pull/8266 which will be available with 2.9

`FEATURE:  I18n.translate() now accept $source to contain dots instead of only a path to the translation file <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/2476>`_
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

``translateByExplicitlyPassedOrderedArguments()`` and ``I18n.translate()`` now accept ``$source`` argument to contain dots instead of only a path to the translation file.

When we use translations we use for example the shorthand::

 {I18n.translate('Muensmedia.DistributionPackage:NodeTypes.Content.Todo.Container:ui.label')}

when we want to pass arguments we had to use::

 ${I18n.translate('progress', null, {solved: this.checkedElementsCount, total: this.checkboxCount}, 'NodeTypes/Content/Todo/Container', 'Muensmedia.DistributionPackage')}

As you can see, you have to pass the **path** to the translation file instead of the well known dot-notation.

This commit enables you to use also the well known dot-notation for the source argument::

${I18n.translate('progress', null, {solved: this.checkedElementsCount, total: this.checkboxCount}, 'NodeTypes.Content.Todo.Container', 'Muensmedia.DistributionPackage')}

In the method ``translateByShortHandString()`` we already replace dots with slashes, so I just copied this behavior to the method ``translateByExplicitlyPassedOrderedArguments()``

`!!! BUGFIX: Avoid broken proxy docblocks <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/2568>`_
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With PR `#2533 <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/issues/2533>`_ docblocks are copied from the original class to the proxy class. This breaks when using annotations without the "standard" imports ``Flow`` and ``ORM``. One example is the ImportedAsset domain model.

This fixes that by some changes to the proxy building.

Note, if you use property introduction via AOP, those properties must from now on use fully-qualified classnames for annoatations on them!

`BUGFIX: Do not pass signal information to persistAll <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/2582>`_
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With PR `#2448 <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/issues/2448>`_ the ``shouldCheck()`` was added, having a return type
declaration of ``bool``. The value returned is set only by the argument
given to ``persistAll()``, so having Behat tests fail when the value was
a string seemed strange.

The actual value was even stranger::

    Neos\\\Flow\\\Cli\\\SlaveRequestHandler::dispatchedCommandLineSlaveRequest

Reason: The ``Package`` class in ``Neos.Flow`` connects a signal to the
``persistAll()`` method, and the "signal information" is passed as an
argument…

This change fixes that.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As of https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/1213
the authentication providers are created using a factory method, this
breaks the assumption the ``TestingProvider`` is a singleton.

The result is that e.g. ``authenticateRoles([])`` no longer works as
expected in functional tests.

This fixes the issue by fetching the provider from the factory instead
of the object manager.

`BUGFIX: Handle required and exceeding arguments properly in combination with cli array arguments  <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/2562>`_
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When a cli argument of type array was used it was not removed from the list of required arguments and thus
later when unnamed arguments where checked was regarded as still missing. That way exceeding unnamed arguments could not be used together with required array arguments.

This is solved by having an explicit list of required argumentNames instead of removing the configuration of a
required argument after it was set.

This fixes an issue with the array feature that was introduced with `#2519 <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/issues/2519>`_

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The ``NullBackend`` just return's ``true`` in ``setProperty()`` for all configured properties.

I'm using split sources Objects.local.yaml to disable caches in my local setup where I only change the ``backend:`` configuration to ``Neos\\Cache\\Backend\\NullBackend``.

The problem I have is, that the Objects.yaml merge strategy also includes the ``backendOptions`` and thus by just using::

 Neos_Fusion_Content:
   backend: Neos\\Cache\\Backend\\NullBackend

in my ``Objects.local.yaml`` I get an Exception, thrown by AbstractBackend, that the ``NullBackend`` doesn't accept the backendOption ``hostname`` - from my default redis configuration.

`BUGFIX: Bring back RenderingContext view argument, pin Fluid version <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/2546>`_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With ``typo3fluid/fluid`` 2.7.0 the ``$view`` constructor argument to
``RenderingContext`` is gone, but we support lower versions, thus things
break.

This brings back the argument in our code and pins Fluid to < 2.7.0
for Flow below 7.2.0.

`BUGFIX: Extract doctrine EventListener functionality from PersistenceManager <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/2448>`_
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With the changes in `#2423 <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/issues/2423>`_ the PersistenceManager was registered as a Doctrine EventListener.
Hence, when building the EntityManager, the PersistenceManager got instanciated with a completely new non-lazy EntityManager. This caused errors when trying to persist entities, as they were not known to that instance of the EntityManager.
This change extracts the EventListener behaviour from the PersistenceManager.

`BUGFIX: Avoid using the same widget id after session timeout <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/2509>`_
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If a session times out and the user starts a new one the AjaxWidgetContextHolder assigned ids starting from 0 to each widget id, which might conflict with already generated pages, which had a different widget generating this id.

Now each ajax widget gets an uuid, avoiding such type of collisions.

`BUGFIX: Do not run before and afterControllerInvocation signals in compile time <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/2529>`_
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Together with Flow 6.x the Cli commands have been seperated from the Http ActionControllers.

Before these slots have been guaranteed to be executed during runtime only. This patch restores
that behavior. There will be another commit against master, which introduces new 4 new signals,
so in future you can even use compile time slots.

`BUGFIX: Return first existing annotation, not "current" one <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/2536>`_
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In some cases this error comes up::

    Trying to get property 'lazy' of non-object in ConfigurationBuilder

The reason for the error is the fact that the ``current()`` call does not return the existing annotation instance. The array pointer seems to point somewhere else. Using ``reset()`` instead of current solves the issue.

Using ``reset()`` does not really alter the (promised) behaviour of the method, so it is used instead.

`BUGFIX: Keep authorization checks disabled if an exception is swallowed <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/2522>`_
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When code is wrapped in a ``Security\\Context::withoutAuthorizationChecks()`` call
and exceptions are caught, authorization checks are no longer disabled in the outer
closure leading to exceptions like::

 The security Context cannot be initialized yet

This change fixes this by resetting the ``authorizationChecksDisabled`` to the
previous value in a ``finally`` block.

Before it was possible to set the filename to ``null``::

but without this fix, you have to set the source to ``Main``::

 I18n.translate('foo', null, [], 'Main', 'Foo.Bar')

`BUGFIX: Change empty check on target collection to valid() in resource:copy <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/2513>`_
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

``$targetCollection->getObjects()`` method returns a generator, which will always return ``false`` in an ``empty()`` check.
This makes it impossible to use ``resource:copy`` as this always fails with a ``The target collection "tmpNewCollection" is not empty.`` error.

The problem is mentioned here: https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/issues/2510

**What I did**
Change ``!empty()`` against a ``->valid()`` check

**How to verify it**
Use ``resource:copy`` to copy assets to an empty Storage.

`BUGFIX: retrieve package by case insensitive packageKey <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/2493>`_
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The ``PackageManager::getPackage($packageKey)`` method should throw an exception or return the found package. There is a case, such that ``getPackage`` returns ``null``. In recent php versions, this causes a php error because the return value of the api ``public function getPackage($packageKey): PackageInterface`` is not met:

``Exception in line 514 of /…/Flow_Object_Classes/Neos_Flow_ResourceManagement_Streams_ResourceStreamWrapper.php: Return value of Neos\\Flow\\Package\\PackageManager::getPackage() must implement interface Neos\\Flow\\Package\\PackageInterface, null returned - See also: 202106101712258f223a.txt``

In older flow versions (4.0 and up), this might also be a problem, because the method actually can return null instead of throwing an exception.

**Problem analysis**

The problem occures, because the check, if an exception should be thrown by ``isPackageAvailable()``, ignores the case during the check, whereas the actual return statement ``return $this->packages[$packageKey];`` needs the correct case.

**How I did it**

I'm using ``$this->getCaseSensitivePackageKey($packageKey)`` to retrieve the key in the correct case, such that ``$this->packages`` returns the correct package.

**How to verify it**

A call like ``$packageManager->getPackage('Neos.some.package.with.wrong.case')`` should throw a php error in recent versions.

`BUGFIX: Avoid open_basedir restriction with realpath <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/2491>`_
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I encountered the following error in the setup (/setup/index?step=1):

(Plesk / PHP7.4 / Flow7.1)

.. image:: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85400359/121085865-b51c5000-c7e2-11eb-81f8-602eb0c51167.png


The error source::

  $realPhpBinary = realpath(PHP_BINARY);

My web hoster doesn't allow me to change the open_basedir to include "/usr/local/php74/bin/php".

But using:
``php -r "echo realpath(PHP_BINARY);"``
in ``exec()`` will work and bypass open_basedir.

Implemented::

 exec(PHP_BINARY . ' -r "echo realpath(PHP_BINARY);"', $output);
 $realPhpBinary = $output[0];

Tested with:
(Plesk / PHP7.4 / Flow7.1)

``exec()`` is also used in a similar manner on line 844: ``exec($phpBinaryPathAndFilename . ' -r "echo realpath(PHP_BINARY);"', $output, $result);``

... using realpath was introduced with `#2032 <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/issues/2032>`_

**Recap**

This change brings up the compatibility for some ISPs(web hosting)

By getting the realPhpBinary see #2032:
``$realPhpBinary = realpath(PHP_BINARY);``
a Neos\\Flow\\Error\\Exception is thrown with the Code: 1355480641
``Warning: realpath(): open_basedir restriction in effect. File(/usr/local/php74/bin/php) is not within the allowed path(s)``
on the most(rather all) web hosting platforms(f.x. Plesk).

By using system commands to get the realpath inside exec() this behavior can be avoided.

`BUGFIX: Ensure cache backends are prepared before usage <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/2500>`_
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If the flushByTag or findIdentifiersByTag methods of the TaggableMultiBackend are used before backend initialization by other methods, the backends have to be prepared. Otherwise, ``$this->backends`` is an empty array and no cache entries are flushed.

**What I did**
I added the ``$this->prepareBackends()`` calls in the two methods.

**How to verify it**
- Configure the TaggableMultiBackend for the Neos_Fusion_Content cache
- Change a node property in the Neos backend
- Reload the page

Before this change, the change of the node property was saved to the db, but the cache was not flushed. Thus, the incorrect property value was shown in the Neos backend after a page reload.

`BUGFIX: Apply Content-Type header from PSR-7 Responses <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/2478>`_
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before this change a content type set as header in a
rendered view would be ignored.
As example this resulted in an incorrect header for FusionViews
which rendered a PSR-7 Response with a non html Content-Type.

This broke due the middleware change in Flow 6, as the behaviour of ``applyToHttpResponse`` was different than the now used ``replaceHttpResponse``.

Fixes: https://github.com/neos/neos-development-collection/issues/3346

**What I did**

Set response content type based on content type header optionally provided by a rendered view.

**How I did it**

If the view returns a PSR-7 Response and contains a ``Content-Type`` header, it is applied to the final response.

**How to verify it**

Run tests.

`TASK: Disallow installing guzzlehttp/psr7 2.0 <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/2502>`_
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is incompatible with versions < 1.7 due to the replaced ``stream_for`` method. The ~2.0 dependency was added before the actual 2.0 release and this breaking change was added later, making it incompatible. If 2.0+ is needed, you need to upgrade to Flow 7.1

`TASK: Allow installing Doctrine 2.9 <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/2496>`_
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As of doctrine/orm 2.9.3 it is again compatible with Flow (see #2495), so we can allow installing it (again).
