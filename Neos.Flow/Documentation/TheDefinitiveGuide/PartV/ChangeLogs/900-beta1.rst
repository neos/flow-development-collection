Overview of merged pull requests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`FEATURE: Add more information for object arguments in debugging <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/3211>`_
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For stacktraces in exceptions and logs we now render some representation of content for objects to ease debugging with DTOs.

Specifically we will try to obtain a string representation for such an object by using either in this order:

- a string cast if __toString() is available
- json_encode if it is JsonSerializable
- json_encode on the array of public properties

For readability json_encode will be limited to the first level, also all of those string representations will be cut off after 100 characters.

If any of those options works we will also shorten the className to avoid this output becoming overly long.

Note that we use JSON_PARTIAL_OUTPUT_ON_ERROR to make sure some output is provided. This might lead to partial or weird outputs depending on the object structure, but might still provide pointers for debugging.

`9.0 FEATURE: Add `unique` flowQuery operation <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/3102>`_
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This operation applies ``array_unique`` to the current flowQuery context.

While the same could previously achieved via ``Array.unique()`` the flow query operation can be placed in an operation chain without extra wrapping.

**Review instructions**

There is also a node specific implementation of the ``unique`` operation in https://github.com/neos/neos-development-collection/pull/4355

I know the php code looks oldish but the style is in line with the other flowQuery operations around.

`FEATURE: Add `getAccessorByPath` to `Neos\Utility\Arrays` for type safe accessing of array values <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/3149>`_
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The array utility allows to create a type safe accessor via ``Arrays::getAccessorByPath($arrayValue, 'your.path')``. The accessor provides the following methods that will either return the requested type or throw a ``\\UnexpectedValueException``.  

* ``int(): int``
* ``float(): float``
* ``number(): int|float``
* ``string(): string``
* ``classString(): string`` - with annotation for class-string
* ``array(): array``
* ``instanceOf(string $className): object`` - with annotation for dynamic type
* ``intOrNull(): ?int``
* ``floatOrNull(): ?float``
* ``numberOrNull(): null|int|float``
* ``stringOrNull(): ?string``
* ``classStringOrNull(): ?string`` - with annotation for class-string | null
* ``arrayOrNull(): ?array``
* ``instanceOfOrNull(string $className): ?object`` - with annotation for dynamic type | null

This will allow to write code that accesses settings via pathes without checking every level for existence still beeing type safe and accessible for static analysis.

This can be used together with settingInjection.

```php
public function injectSettings(array $settings): void
{
   $this->limit = Arrays::getAccessorByPath($settings, 'limit')->intOrNull();
}
```

* Resolves: `#3164 <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/issues/3164>`_

**Review instructions**

It may look inefficient to manually throw TypeErrors that in many cases would be thrown automatically because of the declared return types. However this is not a performance issue as those are never on the happy-path and the created TypeError provides additional informations to help understand and fix problems faster.

`FEATURE: Exclude classes from constructor autowiring <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/3070>`_
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Classes can now explicitly be excluded from constructor autowiring through a new setting.

The setting accepts an array of fully qualified class names, each class name being a regular expression. Classes of scope prototype which expect objects to be passed to their constructor are usually considered for autowiring which results in a proxy class being generated.

This option allows to exclude classes from this process. This is useful for classes like data transfer objects, read models, commands, events and value objects which usually don't rely on dependency injection.

Flow cannot reliably detect weather a prototype class depends on autowiring for constructor arguments or not. Use this option to optimize your application to avoid the small but measurable overhead of proxy generation for those kinds of classes.

Note that if there are other reasons than constructor injection which require a proxy class to be generated, the proxy class will be generated no matter what.

This change partly reverts `#3050 <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/issues/3050>`_because now proxy classes _are_ generated for prototype classes by default. Otherwise a lot of existing Flow applications would not work correctly anymore.

`FEATURE: Replace self with static in proxy classes <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/3074>`_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Factory methods which use code like new self() for creating a new instance are now handled correctly in proxy classes. The compiler automatically replaces "self" keywords with "static" in the rendered proxy class file to make this possible.

This implementation has not been optimized for performance.

`FEATURE: Support private constructors in proxy classes <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/3072>`_
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Flow now can correctly build proxy classes for classes with private constructors. Previously, such classes caused errors and proxy class building had to be disabled with the ``Proxy(false)`` annotation. Now classes with private constructors can take advantage of setter and property injection and are considered for advices through the AOP framework.

`BUGFIX: Only set distinct on count clause if explicitely set to improve performance <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/3140>`_
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

F.e. Postgres has performance issues with large datasets and the DISTINCT clause. In a test this change reduced the query time of a count query for ~900.000 entities by >80%.

In a custom project this affected their Neos Media.UI in which the following results were found:

* Count all assets |  580ms ->  260ms
* Query 20 assets  |  690ms ->  350ms
* Query 100 assets |  990ms -> 650ms
* Module load | 1900ms -> 1400ms

**Review instructions**

Everything should work the same, as https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/415 already sets the distinct flag where (possibly) necessary.

`BUGFIX: Sanitize uploaded svg files from suspicious content <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/3172>`_
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Adding an internal methods ``isSanitizingRequired`` and ``sanitizeImportedFileContent`` to the resourceManager. The import is adjusted to first determine the mediaType of an imported resource to decide wether sanitizing is needed which for now happens only for SVG files. If no sanitizing is needed the code will perform as before by passing streams or filenames around.

If suspicious content was removed from a warning is logged that mentions the remove data and line. The sanitizing is done using "enshrined/svg-sanitize" that is used by other cms aswell.

The initial implementation will only sanitize SVG files as those can contain malicious scripts. In future this should be expanded to a feature that allows registering of custom sanitizing functions.

The sanitizing logic itself ist basically the same as what is done by typo3 here: https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/blob/`357b07064cf2c7f1735cfb8f73ac4a7248ab040e <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/commit/357b07064cf2c7f1735cfb8f73ac4a7248ab040e>`_/typo3/sysext/core/Classes/Resource/Security/SvgSanitizer.php

This addresses the issue described here: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-37611

**Review Instructions**

The change adds quite a bit of complexity to the importResource method to avoid loading the file content into ram whenever possible. As this method accepts filenames and resources this leads to quite some nested checking. I consider this kindoff necessary as one does not want to read a full video file into php ram to check wether it may be an svg. 

Better suggestions are welcome.

`BUGFIX: Replacement proxy methods rendered again <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/3101>`_
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This fixes a bug introduced in d939e6b8 switching to laminuas-code. A proxy method can replace the full body of an existing method or even be a fully new method, in which case only ``body`` will be set in the proxy method. We still want those to be generated. This for example currently breaks the CompileStatic feature, as those methods do not get rendered anymore resulting in worse performance in Production context compared to before.

This fix renders a proxy method also when a body was set for it, but still skips it if neither pre/post nor body is set.

It also enabled CompileStatic in Testing Context so that it is testable and adds a test to make sure it works as intended.

`BUGFIX: Create serialization code for transient properties <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/3063>`_
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Due to a recent optimization, Flow was not generating ``__sleep()`` methods for classes which are not either entities or were configured with a session scope. This led to errors in classes which were using the ``@Transient`` annotation to exclude certain properties from serialization. Therefore, Flow now also generates proxy classes with ``__sleep()`` methods if the original class contains such annotations.

`BUGFIX: Skip proxy for optional straight values <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/3052>`_
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When a promoted property was an optional straight value, the proxy class builder decided to create a proxy class because it could be a straight value configured in the object configuration via Objects.yaml. Flow now checks the value of the given argument and only triggers proxy class building if the argument is not null. That way, Flow will not build useless proxies for typical read models which expect a mix of objects and straight values in their constructor.

`BUGFIX: Move access to objectAccess of TemplateObjectAccessInterface into getByPath <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/3041>`_
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

... as accessors are not used anymore for variable provider within fluid, starting v2.8.0.

Due to the missing accessors the ``objectAccess`` of ``TemplateObjectAccessInterface`` didn't get called anymore, so the result of the ``getByPath`` method was an object of ``FusionPathProxy`` instead of an rendered string.

`!!! TASK: Modernized code style in ReflectionService <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/2914>`_
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Code in the reflection service was adjusted to the current code style best practices. 

The method arguments in the Reflection Service are now strictly typed. Therefore, third-party code which relied on loose types and passes invalid types, need to be adjusted. Tests in the Flow package were adjusted were necessary.

As part of the clean up, the setStatusCache() method in ReflectionService was fixed which used a wrong order of parameters in its is_callable() call.

`TASK: Only add serialization entities code if needed <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/3047>`_
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Proxy classes created by the Dependency Injection Proxy Class Builder now only contain code related to serialization and deserialization of related entities if needed.

The code is only rendered if one of the following conditions is met:

- The class is annotated with Entity
- The class is annotated with Scope("session")

Despite the previous condition, the code will not be rendered if the following condition is true:

- The class already has a __sleep() method (we assume that the developer wants to take care of serialization themself)

As part of this change, the generated code related to serialization was slightly adjusted for stricter type handling.

**Review instructions**

- try to find an existing application which relies on serialization of related entities, for example a Flow application which uses ORM with relations or uses entities in a session scope.
- remove all caches and then access your application in a browser using the current Flow 9 branch (without this patch)
- create a backup of the Cache/Code/Flow_Object_Classes directory
- switch to a branch with this change, remove all caches and access the application again in a browser
- use a diff tool (e.g. Kaleidoscope) to compare both cache directories to see what is now different
- check if your application still works
