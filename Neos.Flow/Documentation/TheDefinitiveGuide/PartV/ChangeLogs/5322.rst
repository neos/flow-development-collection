`BUGFIX: Return correct type for EEL trunc math helper <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/2369>`_
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The internally used `ceil` and `floor` methods of the `trunc` helper return a float which doesn’t
match the signature anymore and leads to unexpected comparison issues when using this helper in Fusion.

**What I did**

Cast the return values to int.

**How I did it**

See above

**How to verify it**

Call `trunc` with a positive int as parameter and check the type of the returned value. Instead of an int you would get a float.

`TASK: Update documentation to remove deprecated Doctrine connection <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/2371>`_
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since doctrine/dbal 2.11 PrimaryReadReplicaConnection should be used.
This change updates the documentation to reflect this change.
See https://github.com/doctrine/dbal/issues/4052 for details.

This is a backport of #2251

`BUGFIX: Set Flow_Security_Cryptography_HashService defaultLifetime explicitly <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/2345>`_
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Otherwise changing the default configs defaultLifetime will also make this cache be emptied unexpectedly and unnecessarily.

`TASK: Fix some docblock typehints <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/2351>`_
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This only fixes a couple of docblock typehints primarily in the ResourceManagement and TypeConverters.

`BUGFIX: Correctly handle missing configuration with identity creation <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/2349>`_
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The code did not handle a missing `$configuration` when converting an hash and data array containing an identifier.

`BUGFIX: Fix creation of translations with targetLanguageKeys defined <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/2343>`_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**What I did**

Previously, when trying to create translation files with targetLanguageKeys defined (`flow kickstart:translation --target-language-keys="de"` for example), an error was thrown. 
The error said, that translationUnits is not defined in Neos\\Kickstarter\\Service\\GeneratorService. This is, because Neos\\Flow\\I18n\\Xliff\\V12\\XliffParser::getParsedData will return an array (for each <file>-Entry in the Xliff-File, typically only one entry). So we need to use the first item of that data to get the translationUnits from it. 

**How I did it**

I only made a little change and added `[0]` to `$parsedXliffArray` in `Neos\\Kickstarter\\Service\\GeneratorService::generateTranslation()`.

**How to verify it**

1. Try to kickstart a translation with `--target-language-keys` defined. An error will be thrown.
2. Change `$parsedXliffArray['translationUnits']` to `$parsedXliffArray[0]['translationUnits']` in the foreach loop of `Neos\\Kickstarter\\Service\\GeneratorService::generateTranslation()`.
3. Retry to kickstart the translations.

`BUGFIX: Don't access static properties in annotation classes <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/2335>`_
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`get_class_vars()` will also return static properties. Hence we also try to access static properties for rendering the annotation and access them non-statically. This will lead to errors.

See https://github.com/zircote/swagger-php/issues/359#issuecomment-303058035 / https://github.com/zircote/swagger-php/issues/359#issuecomment-303227013

This solves that by using `get_object_vars()`, which will only return non-static properties with their current values.

`TASK: Improve exception when a class can not be loaded during AOP building <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/2326>`_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This will now throw an exception that suggests to flush caches or check the existence and namespacing of the aspect class.

Until now such a case would lead to an unhelpful exception of:
```
Warning: Invalid argument supplied for foreach() in /…/Packages/Framework/Neos.Flow/Classes/Aop/Builder/ProxyClassBuilder.php line 319
```
because the following `get_class_methods()` call would return `null` which is not checked for.

`TASK: Replace symfony polyfills due to min PHP version <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/2331>`_
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

See https://github.com/symfony/polyfill#design

This prevents installing the symfony polyfills for php <= 7.1 and mbstring, since those are requirements of this Flow version.

`TASK: Fix link target of CGL on one page PDF <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/2317>`_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Clicking the preview image on https://flowframework.readthedocs.io/en/stable/TheDefinitiveGuide/PartV/CodingGuideLines/PHP.html#cgl-on-one-page leads to a 404 currently

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`./flow doctrine:create && ./flow doctrine:migrationversion --add --version all` directly initializes the database schema and marks all migrations as done. This can be a helpful alternative initial setup in some cases.

`BUGFIX: FileSystemStorage::getObjects correctly returns a generator of StorageObject <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/2167>`_
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Somehow this went unnoticed and the `getObjects()` method returned a generator generator. Also the element type docblock was wrong.
