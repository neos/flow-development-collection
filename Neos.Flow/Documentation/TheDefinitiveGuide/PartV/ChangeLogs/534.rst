`Revert "TASK: Include TYPO3Fluid for reflection" <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/1760>`_
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This reverts commit `e5bb869d3d1262080bbe687095e7b4a58789d971 <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/commit/e5bb869d3d1262080bbe687095e7b4a58789d971>`_.

This is necessary, because the inclusion of Fluid in reflection for 4.3 introduced a regression, due to a wrong annotation in Fluid versions < 2.3.

See https://github.com/TYPO3/Fluid/pull/260

Fixes #1756

NOTE: This revert should not be included in upmerges, since the issue does not exist in Flow 5.0+ as it requires Fluid 2.5 minimum

`TASK: Loosen typo3fluid/fluid dependency <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/1757>`_
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Adjusts the dependency declared in `neos/fluid-adaptor` to complement https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/1638 and thus fix https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/1756

`BUGFIX: Fix PdoBackend status & setup <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/1690>`_
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This fixes the `PdoBackend::getStatus()` and `PdoBackend::setup()` implementation
by getting rid of the Doctrine dependency.

Background:

When configuring the `PdoBackend` to use the same database that already
contains tables with special Doctrine type mappings (for example `flow_json_array`)
comparing the schema led to an exception.

Fixes: #1513
