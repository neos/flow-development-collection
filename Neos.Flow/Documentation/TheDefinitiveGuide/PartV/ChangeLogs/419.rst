`BUGFIX: Allow TypeConverters to use the short name for bool and int <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/1112>`_
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This re-applies the original fix (#1083) with some adjustments
in order to prevent regressions:

* The `StringConverter` is no longer incorrectly adjusted
* The `PropertyMapper` now normalizes source and target types
  to build the "typeConverterMap"

As a result, TypeConverters can now specify short and long version
in the source/target type definition.

`Revert "BUGFIX: Force PropertyMapper to correctly handle bool in constructor" <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/1109>`_
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reverts neos/flow-development-collection#1083

Background: That PR broke the Neos export for boolean properties (see https://github.com/neos/neos-development-collection/issues/1732).
Also it was merged into 4.0 and not into the lowest supported branch (3.3) as stated.

I revert this now as a hotfix because I failed to completely comprehend the PR (I changed the `StringConverter` back and all tests were still green).

`BUGFIX: Correct use of \`void\` return type in proxy classes <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/1091>`_
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As `void` was not on the list of return types that would be
normalized to include a leading backslash in the reflection
data it would be output wrongly in proxy classes and so break
applications that used it.

Fixes: #1065

`TASK: Add a default .editorconfig <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/1097>`_
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This introduces a default ``.editorconfig`` file in the root of the freshly created project.

It ensures that php follows the PSR-2 coding-style, yaml gets 2 spaces indentation and md files doesn't trim trailing whitespace.

`TASK: Fix some numbered lists in security documentation <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/1105>`_
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This fixes markup for some numbered lists in the security documentation.

`TASK: Fix FlowQuery Tests for PHP 7.1 <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/1101>`_
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The newly added test in https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/1085 made the test fail in PHP 7.1 due to wrongly trying to concat strings with `+`.
