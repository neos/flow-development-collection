`BUGFIX: Skip private methods in SessionObjectMethodsPointcutFilter <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/2193>`_
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The matches() method did not skip private methods, so Flow tried to build interceptors for them. That breaks as of the bugfix in https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/2131, leading to https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/issues/2190

Additionally a potential bug in the regular expression used to skip certain methods is fixed. Without the grouping the first alternative was anchored to the start, the last to the end, but others could be anywhere in the string.
