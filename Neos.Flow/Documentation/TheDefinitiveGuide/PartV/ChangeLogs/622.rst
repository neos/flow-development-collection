` BUGFIX: Set session cookie after flash message storage <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/2047>`_
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The FlashMessages component by default uses the SessionStorage, which depends on sending the session cookie through the SessionResponse component. However, the FlashMessages component was configured to be run **after** the session component. That way, unless a session was (still) open, the `Set-Cookie` was not sent and hence the flash message got lost.
This was primarily visible after logging out and redirecting the user with a flash message.

Thanks @astehlik for finding the root cause!

Resolves #1807 

* Packages: ``Flow``

`TASK: Use argument unpacking instead of call_user_func_array <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/1972>`_
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is supported since PHP 5.6 and is actually faster than call_user_func_array at least since PHP 7.
Just be sure to not use it in places where the method is static or a Closure.
This also deprecates `ObjectAccess::instantiateClass()` (retrospectively). It will be removed with Flow 7.

`BUGFIX: Make php binary setting check use realpath <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/2032>`_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The check if the current executing php binary path as set in `PHP_BINARY` matches the given setting in `phpBinaryPathAndFilename` was case-sensitive. This check is only done when the setting is specified and should guarantee that the path specified refers to the same binary as the one executing the current script. On Windows, the filesystem is case-insensitive by default though (Windows 10 has options to make it case-sensitive) and the chance that someone accidentially gets the casing of the path wrong on windows is (arguably) much more likely than someone having different versions of php installed on a case-sensitive filesystem in pathes `/foo/PHP/php` and `/foo/php/php` respectively.
~Even if that would be the case, if the two versions do not match the check at `ensureWebSubrequestsUseCurrentlyRunningPhpVersion` would still throw an error with an even more specific message.~

So this will prevent irritating errors on Windows in the form of

`BUGFIX: Check if PdoBackend cache tables exist in setup <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/2040>`_
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Running the setup for a PdoBackend multiple times should
not lead to an error, similar to other Backends.

Resolves: #2039

**What I did**
Allow PdoBackend::setup() to be called multiple times.

**How I did it**
Check if cache tables exist in PdoBackend::setup() before creating them.

**How to verify it**
See #2039

`BUGFIX: Avoid trying to autowire constructor arguments for factory created objects <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/2002>`_
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This bug was uncovered with the previous fix to not map arguments to the object when a factory is configured (see #1967).
That way (singleton) objects which expected a (non-optional/nullable) constructor argument that could not be autowired (e.g. because it was a scalar) would lead to the exception "Could not autowire required constructor argument ... for singleton class ...".
This change fixes that, by completely skipping autowiring for objects configured with a factory. The factory has full responsibility to create and wire the constructor arguments correctly.

`TASK: Improve wording of include/exclude concepts where possible <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/2024>`_
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Those old wordings have no place and they are also objectively worse than the replacements.

`BUGFIX: Allow Views to replace the response in AjaxWidgetContext <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/2028>`_
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If a WidgetController has a view returning a PSR-7 response, it
was not replaced in Ajax context. Now the behavior of the
ReplaceComponent is merged into the AjaxWidgetComponent, so the
expected ActionController behavior can be guaranteed

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This fixes psalm errors due to the namespace renaming of various doctrine classes in doctrine/orm 2.7.3 release. The old class name was an alias since 2.7, so this should not break anything. 🤞
