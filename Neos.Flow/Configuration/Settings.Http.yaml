      # Defines the "application token" which is sent by in HTTP Response "X-Flow-Powered" headers.
      #
      # The value can be one of:
      #
      # - "Off" (no application token header is sent)
      # - "ApplicationName" (the application name only, determined via the Neos.Flow.core.applicationKey setting)
      # - "MajorVersion" (the application name + major version, e.g. "Neos/2"

      trustedProxies:

        # Defines Proxy servers which are trusted for setting request headers
        # By default no proxies are trusted, unless the environment variable FLOW_HTTP_TRUSTED_PROXIES is set.
        # If you have some reverse proxies or CDN running in front of your server, you should provide
        # an array list of those servers' addresses or address ranges (in CIDR notation) here.
        # Alternatively, you can provide a comma separated list of address ranges, which is useful when
        # specifying the addresses through the environment variable.
        #
        # If you are unsure, you can set the option to "*" to trust all proxies, but this is not recommended.
        #
        # proxies:
        #   - '216.246.40.0/24'
        #   - '216.246.100.0/24'
        proxies: '%env:FLOW_HTTP_TRUSTED_PROXIES%'

        # Defines request headers which are trusted from proxies to override important request information
        # Each value can be a single header or a comma separated list of headers
        headers:
          # This is a list mainly for backwards-compatibility. You should only set a single header, e.g. 'X-Forwarded-For'
          clientIp: 'Client-Ip,X-Forwarded-For,X-Forwarded,X-Cluster-Client-Ip,Forwarded-For,Forwarded'
