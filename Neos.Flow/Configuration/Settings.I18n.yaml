        # Additionally, you can define patterns that you want to further skip inside the scanned paths.

        # Example:
        #   includePaths:
        #     '/Public/': TRUE
        #     '/Private/images/': TRUE
        #   excludePatterns:
        #     '/node_modules/': TRUE
        #
        #   This will scan all of the Public Resources folder, as well as the 'images' sub-folder inside the Private
        #   Resources, except any 'node_modules' sub-folder in either one.

          '/Public/': TRUE

          # skip folders starting with a dot (e.g. '.git', '.sass-cache', etc.)
