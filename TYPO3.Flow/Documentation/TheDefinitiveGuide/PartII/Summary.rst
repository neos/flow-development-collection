Next Steps
==========

This is the end of the Getting Started Tutorial. You now have a first
impression of what a TYPO3 Flow application looks like and how the most important
modules of TYPO3 Flow work together.

You now have two options for delving further into TYPO3 Flow programming:

-	Start completing the missing functionality on your own and while you
	do, read further parts of the TYPO3 Flow reference manual
-	Install the finished blog example and explore its code by reading and
	modifying it

If you can't wait to see the finished blog all you need to do is:

-	Delete your blog package (that is *Packages/Application/TYPO3.Blog/*) and then
-	Clone the Blog package from git://git.typo3.org/Packages/TYPO3.Blog.git
