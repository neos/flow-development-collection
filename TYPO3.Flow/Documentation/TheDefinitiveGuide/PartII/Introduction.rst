What's TYPO3 Flow
=================

TYPO3 Flow is a PHP-based application framework. It is especially well-suited for
enterprise-grade applications and explicitly supports Domain-Driven Design, a
powerful software design philosophy. Convention over configuration, Test-Driven
Development, Continuous Integration and an easy-to-read source code are other
important principles we follow for the development of TYPO3 Flow. Needless to say,
TYPO3 Flow provides you with a full-stack MVC framework for building
state-of-the-art web applications. More exciting though are the first class
Dependency Injection support and the Aspect-Oriented Programming capabilities
which can be used without a single line of configuration.

What's in this tutorial?
========================

This tutorial explains all the steps to get you started with your very own
first TYPO3 Flow project.

Please bring your own computer, a reasonable knowledge of PHP and HTML and at
least some initial experience with object-oriented programming. In return
you'll surely get some new insights into modern programming paradigms and how
to produce clean code in no time.
