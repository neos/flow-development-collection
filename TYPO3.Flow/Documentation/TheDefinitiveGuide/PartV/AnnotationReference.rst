Declares a method as an after returning advice to be triggered
after any pointcut matching the given expression returns.

:Applicable to: Method




Arguments
*********

* ``pointcutExpression`` (string): The pointcut expression. (Can be given as anonymous argument.)

pointcut matching the given expression.

:Applicable to: Method




Arguments
*********

* ``pointcutExpression`` (string): The pointcut expression. (Can be given as anonymous argument.)




.. _`Flow Annotation Reference: Aspect`:

Aspect
------

Marks a class as an aspect.

The class will be read by the AOP framework of Flow and inspected for
pointcut expressions and advice.

:Applicable to: Class





.. _`Flow Annotation Reference: Autowiring`:

Autowiring
----------

Used to disable autowiring for Dependency Injection on the
whole class or on the annotated property only.

:Applicable to: Method, Class




Arguments
*********

* ``enabled`` (boolean): Whether autowiring is enabled. (Can be given as anonymous argument.)

pointcut matching the given expression.

:Applicable to: Method




Arguments
*********

* ``pointcutExpression`` (string): The pointcut expression. (Can be given as anonymous argument.)




.. _`Flow Annotation Reference: CompileStatic`:

CompileStatic
-------------






.. _`Flow Annotation Reference: Entity`:

Entity
------

Marks an object as an entity.

Behaves like \Doctrine\ORM\Mapping\Entity so it is interchangeable
with that.

:Applicable to: Class




Arguments
*********

* ``repositoryClass`` (string): Name of the repository class to use for managing the entity.

* ``readOnly`` (boolean): Whether the entity should be read-only.




.. _`Flow Annotation Reference: FlushesCaches`:

FlushesCaches
-------------

Marks a CLI command as a cache-flushing command.

Usually used for framework purposes only.

:Applicable to: Method





.. _`Flow Annotation Reference: Identity`:

Identity
--------

Marks a property as being (part of) the identity of an object.

If multiple properties are annotated as Identity, a compound
identity is created.

For Doctrine a unique key over all involved properties will be
created - thus the limitations of that need to be observed.

:Applicable to: Property





.. _`Flow Annotation Reference: IgnoreValidation`:

IgnoreValidation
----------------

Used to ignore validation on a specific method argument or class property.

By default no validation will be executed for the given argument. To gather validation results for further
processing, the "evaluate" option can be set to true (while still ignoring any validation error).

:Applicable to: Method, Property




Arguments
*********

* ``argumentName`` (string): Name of the argument to skip validation for. (Can be given as anonymous argument.)

* ``evaluate`` (boolean): Whether to evaluate the validation results of the argument




.. _`Flow Annotation Reference: Inject`:

Inject
------

Used to enable property injection.

Flow will build Dependency Injection code for the property and try
to inject a value as specified by the var annotation.

:Applicable to: Property




Arguments
*********

* ``lazy`` (boolean): Whether the dependency should be injected instantly or if a lazy dependency
  proxy should be injected instead

* ``setting`` (string): Path of a setting (without the package key) which should be injected into the property.
  Example: session.name

* ``package`` (string): Defines the package to be used for retrieving a setting specified via the "setting" parameter. If no package
  is specified, we'll assume the package to be the same which contains the class where the Inject annotation is
  used.
  
  Example: TYPO3.Flow




.. _`Flow Annotation Reference: InjectConfiguration`:

InjectConfiguration
-------------------

Used to enable property injection for configuration including settings.

Flow will build Dependency Injection code for the property and try
to inject the configured configuration.

:Applicable to: Property




Arguments
*********

* ``path`` (string): Path of a configuration which should be injected into the property.
  Can be specified as anonymous argument: InjectConfiguration("some.path")
  
  For type "Settings" this refers to the relative path (excluding the package key)
  
  Example: session.name

* ``package`` (string): Defines the package key to be used for retrieving settings. If no package key is specified, we'll assume the
  package to be the same which contains the class where the InjectConfiguration annotation is used.
  
  Note: This property is only supported for type "Settings"
  
  Example: TYPO3.Flow

* ``type`` (string one of the ConfigurationManager::CONFIGURATION_TYPE_* constants): Type of Configuration (defaults to "Settings").




.. _`Flow Annotation Reference: Internal`:

Internal
--------

Used to mark a command as internal - it will not be shown in
CLI help output.

Usually used for framework purposes only.

:Applicable to: Method





.. _`Flow Annotation Reference: Introduce`:

Introduce
---------

Introduces the given interface or property into any target class matching
the given pointcut expression.

:Applicable to: Class, Property




Arguments
*********

* ``pointcutExpression`` (string): The pointcut expression. (Can be given as anonymous argument.)

* ``interfaceName`` (string): The interface name to introduce.

* ``traitName`` (string): The trait name to introduce




.. _`Flow Annotation Reference: Lazy`:

Lazy
----

Marks a property or class as lazy-loaded.

This is only relevant for anything based on the generic persistence
layer of Flow. For Doctrine based persistence this is ignored.

:Applicable to: Class, Property





.. _`Flow Annotation Reference: Pointcut`:

Pointcut
--------

Declares a named pointcut. The annotated method does not become an advice
but can be used as a named pointcut instead of the given expression.

:Applicable to: Method




Arguments
*********

* ``expression`` (string): The pointcut expression. (Can be given as anonymous argument.)




.. _`Flow Annotation Reference: Proxy`:

Proxy
-----

Used to disable proxy building for an object.

If disabled, neither Dependency Injection nor AOP can be used
on the object.

:Applicable to: Class




Arguments
*********

* ``enabled`` (boolean): Whether proxy building for the target is disabled. (Can be given as anonymous argument.)




.. _`Flow Annotation Reference: Scope`:

Scope
-----

Used to set the scope of an object.

:Applicable to: Class




Arguments
*********

* ``value`` (string): The scope of an object: prototype, singleton, session. (Usually given as anonymous argument.)




.. _`Flow Annotation Reference: Session`:

Session
-------

Used to control the behavior of session handling when the annotated
method is called.

:Applicable to: Method




Arguments
*********

* ``autoStart`` (boolean): Whether the annotated method triggers the start of a session.




.. _`Flow Annotation Reference: Signal`:

Signal
------

Marks a method as a signal for the signal/slot implementation
of Flow. The method will be augmented as needed (using AOP)
to be a usable signal.

:Applicable to: Method





.. _`Flow Annotation Reference: SkipCsrfProtection`:

SkipCsrfProtection
------------------

Action methods marked with this annotation will not be secured
against CSRF.

Since CSRF is a risk for write operations, this is useful for read-only
actions. The overhead for CRSF token generation and validation can be
skipped in those cases.

:Applicable to: Method





.. _`Flow Annotation Reference: Transient`:

Transient
---------

Marks a property as transient - it will never be considered by the
persistence layer for storage and retrieval.

Useful for calculated values and any other properties only needed
during runtime.

:Applicable to: Property





.. _`Flow Annotation Reference: Validate`:

Validate
--------

Controls how a property or method argument will be validated by Flow.

:Applicable to: Method, Property




Arguments
*********

* ``type`` (string): The validator type, either a FQCN or a Flow validator class name.

* ``options`` (array): Options for the validator, validator-specific.

* ``argumentName`` (string): The name of the argument this annotation is attached to, if used on a method. (Can be given as anonymous argument.)

* ``validationGroups`` (array): The validation groups for which this validator should be executed.




.. _`Flow Annotation Reference: ValidationGroups`:

ValidationGroups
----------------





Arguments
*********

* ``validationGroups`` (array): The validation groups for which validation on this method should be executed. (Can be given as anonymous argument.)




.. _`Flow Annotation Reference: ValueObject`:

ValueObject
-----------

Marks the annotate class as a value object.

Regarding Doctrine the object is treated like an entity, but Flow
applies some optimizations internally, e.g. to store only one instance
of a value object.

:Applicable to: Class
