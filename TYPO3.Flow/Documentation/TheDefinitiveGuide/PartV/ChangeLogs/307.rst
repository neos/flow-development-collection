Overview of merged pull requests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`TASK: Fix use of deprecated events in InstallerScripts <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/338>`_
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The CommandEvent and PackageEvent used in InstallerScripts are
deprecated since early 2015.

* Packages: ``Flow``

`TASK: Add documentation about limitations of entity privileges <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/331>`_
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When using inheritance for entities, privileges will only work with the root entity type. This was not documented before.

* Packages: ``Flow``

`TASK: Add permissions check for setfilepermissions.sh <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/106>`_
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Using the ``setfilepermissions.sh`` script fails due to wrong file permissions left by the composer installation (missing executable bit). Added the checking of the file's permissions, and correcting the file's permissions if needed. Mode 0700 is set as the ``setfilepermissions.sh`` script sets it's own permissions to that mode.

FLOW-400 #close

`BUGFIX: Always set subpackage key when setting package key in forward <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/319>`_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The subpackage key is directly derived from the package key in the forward
method. Previously, if the subpackage key was not provided, it would not be
set in the next request.
Therefore to forward to a non-subpackage from a subpackage it was required
to specify the package key with trailing backslashes, so the subpackage key
would resolve to an empty string.

With this change it is possible by just specifying the actual package key
to forward to.

* Packages: ``Flow``

`BUGFIX: If query is null the condition break <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/304>`_
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This change trim the query string, without this change the condition to build the request URI is wrong when the query is null and the URI contains a question mark without request arguments.

* Packages: ``Flow``

`BUGFIX: orphanRemoval must be a true integer <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/313>`_
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Doctrine expects a true integer instead of a string (true in double quots) for the orphanRemoval property.

* Packages: ``Flow``

`TASK: Adjust unit tests mocks to new errors <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/311>`_
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since ``phpunit-mock-objects`` 3.1.0 errors are thrown when a mocked
method is not allowed, non-existing, final or private.

This change adjusts to that change by getting rid of such mistakes in
the tests, which are made visible due to the change.

* Packages: ``Flow`` ``Fluid``

`TASK: Adjust unit tests mocks to new errors <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/310>`_
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since ``phpunit-mock-objects`` 3.1.0 errors are thrown when a mocked
method is not allowed, non-existing, final or private.

This change adjusts to that change by getting rid of such mistakes in
the tests, which are made visible due to the change.

`BUGFIX: Remove duplicate registration of ClassLoader <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/307>`_
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Flow class loader is registered in doctrines annotation reader twice.
First in ``Booting\\Scripts::registerClassLoaderInAnnotationRegistry()``
then again in the ReflectionService. As this is unnecessary and is not
directly related to the ReflectionService the second registration is
removed with this change.

* Packages: ``Flow``
