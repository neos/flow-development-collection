`[BUGFIX] Fix potential issue with .htaccess file <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/commit/87698e4cc60aec7a318c16d77804d828858b8066>`_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The .htaccess file for Web/_Resources contained an AllowOverride
directive that was intended to make sure the setup in the file
could not be overridden again.

This caused errors on setups where AllowOverride was already
prohibited. And due to the way Flow publishes resources, any
overriding would only have an effect on exactly the overriding
file itself. Thus the line is removed again.

In the MediaTypeConverter the libxml entity loader was disabled and
reset, but in case of an exception the reset was never done.
