  <section xml:id="flow3.flow3bootstrap.applicationcontext">
    <title>Application Context</title>

    <para>The FLOW3 Framework can be launched in different application
    contexts. An application context basically is a set of configuration which
    has been defined for a certain context. By default, FLOW3 provides
    configuration for the <literal>Production</literal>,
    <literal>Development</literal>, <literal>Testing</literal>, and
    <literal>Staging</literal> context. More contexts may be defined by just
    adding configuration for it accordingly (refer to the Configuration
    section to learn more about configuration).</para>

    <para>The FLOW3 boot strap (i.e. the class
    <classname>\F3\FLOW3\Core\Bootstrap</classname>) is always instantiated in
    a single application context. By default (when calling the
    <filename>index.php</filename> file) the context is
    <literal>Production</literal>. To switch to another context you need to
    define the environment variable FLOW3_CONTEXT with the corresponding
    value. You can do this either by adding (uncommenting) the corresponding
    line (i.e. <literal>SetEnv FLOW3_CONTEXT Development</literal>) in the
    <filename>.htaccess</filename>-file, which is located in the
    <filename>Public</filename>-folder. Another option is to add this line to
    your virtual hosts configuration.</para>

  <section xml:id="flow3.flow3bootstrap.bootsequence">
    <title>Boot Sequence</title>

    <para>At the time of this writing, the sequence in which the various
    modules of FLOW3 are initialized is hardcoded into the bootstrap. The
    solution we aim for is, however, a more flexible and cleaner approach
    which is allows the modules to register themselves for
    initialization.</para>
