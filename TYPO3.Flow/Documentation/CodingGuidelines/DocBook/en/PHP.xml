  <title>PHP Coding Guidelines &amp; Best Practices</title>

  <para>Coding Standards are an important factor for achieving a high code
  quality. A common visual style, naming conventions and other technical
  settings allow us to produce a homogenous code which is easy to read and
  maintain. However, not all important factors can be covered by rules and
  coding standards. Equally important is the style in which certain problems
  are solved programmatically - it's the personality and experience of the
  individual developer which shines through and ultimately makes the
  difference between technically okay code or a well considered, mature
  solution.</para>

  <para>These guidelines try to cover both, the technical standards as well as
  giving incentives for a common development style. These guidelines must be
  followed by everyone who creates code for the FLOW3 core. Because TYPO3 is
  based on FLOW3, it follows the same principles - therefore, whenever we
  mention FLOW3 in the following sections, we equally refer to TYPO3. We hope
  that you feel encouraged to follow these guidelines as well when creating
  your own packages and FLOW3 based applications.</para>

    <para>The visual style of programming code is very important. In the TYPO3
    project we want many programmers to contribute, but in the same style.
    This will help us to:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Easily read/understand each others code and consequently easily
        spot security problems or optimization opportunities</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>It is a signal about consistency and cleanliness, which is a
        motivating factor for programmers striving for excellence</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Some people may object to the visual guidelines since everyone has
    his own habits. You will have to overcome that in the case of FLOW3; the
    visual guidelines must be followed along with coding guidelines for
    security. We want all contributions to the project to be as similar in
    style and as secure as possible.</para>

        <listitem>
          <para>Almost every PHP file in FLOW3 contains exactly one class and
          does not output anything if it is called directly. Therefore you
          start your file with a <code>&lt;?php</code> tag and end it with the
          closing <code>?&gt;</code>.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Every file must contain a header stating encoding, namespace
          and licensing information</para>

              <listitem>
                <para>Declare your namespace.</para>
              </listitem>

              <listitem>
                <para>The copyright header itself must not start with
                <literal>/**</literal>, as this may confuse documentation
                generators!</para>

    <section>
      <title>Indentation and line formatting</title>

      <para>Indentation is done with tabs - and not spaces! The beginning of a
      line is the only place where tabs are used, in all other places use
      spaces. Always trim whitespace off the end of a line.</para>

      <para>Here's a code snippet which shows the correct usage of tabs and
      spaces:</para>

      <para><example>
          <title>Correct use of tabs and spaces</title>

          <programlisting language="php">/**
 * Returns the name of the currently set context.
 *
 * @return string Name of the current context
 * @author Your Name &lt;your@email.here&gt;
 */
public function getContextName() {
»   return $this-&gt;contextName;
}</programlisting>
        </example></para>

      <para>There seem to be very passionate opinions about whether TABs or
      spaces should be used for indentation of code blocks in the scripts. If
      you'd like to read more about this religious discussion, you find some
      nice arguments in the <link

    <section>
      <title>Naming</title>

      <para>Naming is a repeatedly undervalued factor in the art of software
      development. Although everybody seems to agree on that nice names are a
      nice thing to have, most developers choose cryptic abbreviations in the
      end (to save some typing). Beware that we TYPO3 core developers are very
      passionate about naming (some people call it fanatic, well ...). In our
      opinion spending 15 minutes (or more ...) just to find a good name for a
      method is well spent time! There are zillions of reasons for using
      proper names and in the end they all lead to better readable,
      manageable, stable and secure code.</para>

      <para>As a general note, english words (or abbreviations if neccessary)
      must be used for all class names, method names, comments, variables
      names, database table and field names. The consensus is that english is
      much better to read for the most of us, compared to other languages.</para>

      <para>When using abbreviations or acronyms remember to make them
      camel-cased as needed, no all-uppercase stuff. Admittedly there are a
      few places where we violate that rule willingly (FLOW3, TYPO3 – will not
      change) and historically (e.g. AOP – might change).</para>

      <section>
        <title>Package names</title>

        <para>All package names are start with an uppercase character and
        usually are written in <package>UpperCamelCase</package>. In order to
        avoid problems with different filesystems, only the characters a-z,
        A-Z, 0-9 and the dash sign "-" are allowed for package names – don't
        use special characters.</para>
      </section>

              <para>Only the characters a-z, A-Z and 0-9 are allowed for
              namespace and class names.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Namespaces are usually written in UpperCamelCase but
              variations are allowed for well established names and
              abbreviations.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Class names are always written in
              <classname>UpperCamelCase</classname>.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>The unqualified class name must be meant literally even
              without the namespace.</para>

              <para>The main purpose of namespaces is categorization and

            <listitem>
              <para>The name of abstract classes must start with the word

        <note>
          <para>When specifying class names to PHP, always reference the
          global namespace inside namespaced code by using a leading
          backslash. When referencing a class name inside a string (e.g. given
          to the <methodname>create</methodname>-Method of the
          <classname>ObjectManager</classname>, in pointcut expressions or in
          YAML files), never use a leading backslash. This follows the native
          PHP notion of names in strings always being seen as fully
          qualified.</para>

        <title>Exception names</title>

        <para>Exception naming basically follows the rules for naming classes.
        There are two possible types of exceptions: generic exceptions and
        specific exceptions. Generic exceptions should be named "Exception"
        preceeded by their namespace. Specific exceptions should reside in
        their own sub-namespace end with the word
        <literal>Exception</literal>.</para>

        <title>Method names</title>

        <para>All method names are written in lowerCamelCase. In order to
        avoid problems with different filesystems, only the characters a-z,
        A-Z and 0-9 are allowed for method names – don't use special
        characters.</para>

        <para>Make method names descriptive, but keep them concise at the same
        time. Constructors must always be called
        <function>__construct()</function>, never use the class name as a
        method name.</para>

      <para>To have a clear and focused history of code changes is greatly
      helped by using a consistent way of writing commit messages. Because of

      each release we have defined a fixed syntax for commit messages that is
      to be used.</para>

          <literallayout>[~TASK] FLOW3 (MVC): Short (50 chars or less) summary of changes

More detailed explanatory text, if necessary.  Wrap it to about 72
characters or so.  In some contexts, the first line is treated as the
subject of an email and the rest of the text as the body.  The blank
line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless you omit
the body entirely); tools like rebase can get confused if you run the
two together.

Write your commit message in the present tense: "Fix bug" and not "Fixed
bug."  This convention matches up with commit messages generated by
commands like git merge and git revert.

Further paragraphs come after blank lines.

* Bullet points are okay, too
* An asterisk is used for the bullet, it can bepreceded by a single
  space. This format is rendered correctly by Forge (redmine)
* Use a hanging indent

Resolves: #123
Resolves: #456
Relates to: #789</literallayout>

      <title>Documentation Blocks</title>

      <para>A file contains different documentation blocks, relating to the

      always used for the entity it precedes.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Class documentation</title>

        <para>Classes have their own documentation block describing the
        classes purpose, assigning a package and subpackage. Very often the
        code within a class is expanded and modified by a number of authors.
        We therefore recommend to add the names of the developers to the
        method documentation. An exception should be the documentation for
        interfaces where you list all authors in the interface documentation.
        Exceptions itself never have an author annotation.</para>

        <example>
          <title>Standard class documentation block</title>

      we produce will only cover the public API.<important>

      <para>There are not only documentation annotations that can be used. In

      instructions to the Persistence framework. See the individual chapters
      for information on their purpose and use.</para>

      <para>Here is a list of annotations used within the project. They are

    <title>Best Practices</title>

    <section>
      <title>FLOW3</title>

      <para>This section gives you an overview of FLOW3's coding rules and
      best practices.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Error Handling and Exceptions</title>

        <para>FLOW3 makes use of a hierarchy for its exception classes. The
        general rule is to throw preferably specific exceptions and usually
        let them bubble up until a place where more general exceptions are
        catched. Consider the following example:</para>

        <para>Some method tried to retrieve an object from the object manager.
        However, instead of providing a string containing the object name, the
        method passed an object (of course not on purpose - something went
        wrong). The object manager now throws an
        <classname>InvalidObjectName</classname> exception. In order to catch
        this exception you can, of course, catch it specifically - or only
        consider a more general <classname>Object</classname> exception (or an
        even more general <classname>FLOW3</classname> exception). This all
        works because we have the following hierarchy:</para>

        <literallayout>+ \TYPO3\FLOW3\Exception
  + \TYPO3\FLOW3\Object\Exception
    + \TYPO3\FLOW3\Object\Exception\InvalidObjectNameException</literallayout>

        <section>
          <title>Throwing an exception</title>

          <para>When throwing an exception, make sure to provide a clear error
          message and an error code being the unix timestamp of when you write
          the <function>throw</function> statement. That error code must be
          unique, so watch out when doing copy and paste!</para>

          <para>For every exception there should be a page on the TYPO3 wiki,
          as exception messages link to that page, identified by the error
          code (unix timestamp).</para>

            <listitem>
              <para>Avoid tests for the scope of an object. Those tests test
              the object factory, rather then the test target. Such a test
              should be done by checking for the presence of an expected
              @scope annotation – eventually we will find an elegant way for
              this.</para>

          <para>Prefer strict comparisons whenever possible, to avoid problems

        <listitem>
          <para>Order of methods in classes. To gain a better overview, it
          helps if methods in classes are always ordered in a certain way. We
          prefer the following:<orderedlist>
              <listitem>
                <para>constructor</para>
              </listitem>

                <para>initialization methods (including
                initializeObject())</para>
              </listitem>

              <listitem>
                <para>public methods</para>

        <listitem>
          <para>Avoid double-negation. Instead of
          <literal>exportSystemView(..., $noRecurse)</literal> use
          <literal>exportSystemView(..., $recurse)</literal>. It is more
          logical to pass <constant>TRUE</constant> if you want recursion
          instead of having to pass <constant>FALSE</constant>. In general,
          parameters negating things are a bad idea.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <section>
        <title>Comments</title>

        <para>In general, comments are a good thing and we strive for creating
        a well-documented source code. However, inline comments can often be a
        sign for a bad code structure or method naming.<footnote>
            <para>This is also referred to as a bad "smell" in the theory of
            Refactoring. We highly recommend reading "Refactoring" by Martin
            Fowler - if you didn't already.</para>
          </footnote>As an example, consider the following code:<example>
            <title>Bad coding smell: Comments</title>

            <programlisting language="php">   // We only allow valid perso
if (is_object($p) &amp;&amp; strlen($p-&gt;lastN) &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; $p-&gt;hidden === FALSE &amp;&amp; ↩
  $this-&gt;environment-&gt;moonPhase === MOON_LIB::CRESCENT) {
   $xmM = $thd;
}</programlisting>
          </example></para>

        <para>This is a perfect case for the refactoring technique "extract
        method": In order to avoid the comment, create a new method which is
        as explanatory as the comment:</para>

        <example>
          <title>Smells better!</title>

          <programlisting language="php">if ($this-&gt;isValidPerson($person) {
   $xmM = $thd;
}</programlisting>
        </example>

        <para>Bottom line is: You may (and are encouraged to) use inline
        comments if they support the readability of your code. But always be
        aware of possible design flaws you probably try to hide with
        them.</para>
