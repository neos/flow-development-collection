Font conventions
================

The following font conventions are used in Flow's documentation:

	*Italic*

		Used for URLs, filenames, file extensions, application and package names, emphasis
		and newly introduced term.

	``Monospaced``

		Used for class, variable and property names, annotations and other parts of source
		code which appear in the text.

	Command Line

		Examples which need to be entered at the command line are shown in a separate text
		block. Make sure to not type the dollar sign ``$`` when trying out the commands, as
		it is the Unix prompt character.

		.. code-block:: bash

			$ ./flow kickstart:package Acme.MyPackage
			Created .../Acme.Test/Classes/Acme/Test/Controller/StandardController.php
