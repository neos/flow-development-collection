     * provided this method. This method has never been part of the public API and will be removed in the future.
     *
     * Note that, depending on your Resource Collection setup, this method will not always return the correct base URI,
     * because as of now there can be multiple publishing targets for static resources and URIs of the respective
     * target might not work by simply concatenating a base URI with the relative file name.
     *
     * This method will work for the default Flow setup using only the local file system.
     *
     * Make sure to refactor your client code to use the new resource management API instead. There is no direct
     * replacement for this method in the new API, but if you are dealing with static resources, use the resource stream
     * wrapper instead (through URLs like "resource://TYPO3.Flow/Public/Error/Debugger.css") or use
     * ResourceManager->getPublicPackageResourceUri() if you know the package key and relative path.
