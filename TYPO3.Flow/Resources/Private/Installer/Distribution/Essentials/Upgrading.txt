Upgrading instructions
======================

This file contains instructions for upgrading your Flow 2.1 based
applications to TYPO3 Flow 2.2.

What has changed
----------------

Eel
^^^

The handling of the **boolean short circuit operators** for disjunction and
conjunction has been adjusted to the JavaScript semantics of returning
one of the left or right side values instead of a boolean.

This is only breaking if the code using Eel relied on the exact type
e.g. by using a strict comparison.

Flow
^^^^

The composer **update / install scripts will no longer overwrite the Web/.htaccess**
file. This allows to keep adjustments - it might be needed to adjust that file manually
in the future. This will be announced, though.

If an **@IgnoreValidation** annotation is added for an action argument, the **validation
will not be evaluated** by default anymore. The annotation option "evaluate" can be
set to true to enable the old behaviour of evaluating the validator for the argument
and storing the validation results (while still ignoring any error). This can be used
of the results are needed for further processing.

The **FileMonitor is switched to use json_encode() and json_decode() and a StringBackend**.
This could be breaking if you implemented your own Strategy and use the Flow_Monitor cache
there because it will no longer accept all kinds of variables but only strings.

The **option to provide the plural quantity as a single numeric argument during translation
was removed**. This change is breaking for cases where an application depends on previous
behavior that ``translateBy*`` calls with a single numeric argument would implicate
a quantity for plural form. Also classes extending ``I18n\\Translator`` and using the
protected method ``getPluralForm()`` will break due to a signature change.

If **the PECL YAML extension is installed it will be used** to parse configuration
files, which results in a speed improvement, especially in Development context. This is
breaking if the YAML extension is installed and you have invalid YAML files.

The **status code for persisted entities that can't be found is no longer 500** but
404 now. This is a breaking change only when code relies on the (incorrect) behavior
of returning a status code 500 for entities that couldn't be found.

The **sorting of packages is now done with an depth-first algorithm** that makes sure
that package settings overrule settings from depending packages. This is a breaking
change in case you relied on the previous (and sometimes incorrect) sorting of packages.

Fluid
^^^^^

The **form.validationResults view helper is moved to validation.results** for consistency
reasons. If you use this ViewHelper you should update your Fluid templates from::

 <f:form.validationResults>...</f:form.validationResults>

to::

 <f:validation.results></f:validation.results>

Upgrading your Packages
-----------------------

Upgrading existing code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here comes the easier part. As with earlier changes to TYPO3 Flow that
required code changes on the user side we provide a code migration tool.
Given you have a TYPO3 Flow system with your (outdated) package in place
you should run the following before attempting to fix anything by hand::

 ./flow core:migrate --package-key Acme.Demo

The package key is optional, if left out it will work on all packages
it finds - for the first run you might want to limit things a little to
keep the overview, though.

Inside core:migrate
"""""""""""""""""""

The tool roughly works like this:

* Collect all code migrations from packages

* Collect all files from all packages (except *Framework* and
  *Libraries*) or the package given with ``--package-key``
* For each migration and package

  * Check for clean git working copy (otherwise skip it)
  * Check if migration is needed (looks for Migration footers in commit
    messages)
  * Apply migration and commit the changes

Afterwards you probably get a list of warnings and notes from the
migrations, check those to see if anything needs to be done manually.

Check the created commits and feel free to amend as needed, should
things be missing or wrong. The only thing you must keep in place from
the generated commit messages is the Migration: … footer. It is used to
detect if a migration has been applied already, so if you drop it,
things might get out of hands in the future.

Upgrading the database schema
-----------------------------

Upgrading the schema is done by running::

 ./flow doctrine:migrate

to update your database with any changes to the framework-supplied
schema.

Famous last words
-----------------

In a nutshell, running::

 ./flow core:migrate
 ./flow doctrine:migrationgenerate

padded with some manual checking and adjustments needs to be done. That
should result in a working package.

If it does not and you have no idea what to do next, please come over
to `#typo3-flow <irc://freenode.net/#typo3-flow>`_ on freenode IRC or
ask in the mailing list (news group) as you prefer. The `support page
<http://flow.typo3.org/support.html>`_ provides more information.
