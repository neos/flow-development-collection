TYPO3 Flow 3.x

Welcome to Flow!

There are a few things you need to know to get started.
All necessary steps are explained in the `Getting Started tutorial <http://flowframework.readthedocs.org/en/stable/Quickstart/index.html>`_.

In short here's what you need to do:

1) Set up a virtual host for your web server and let it point to the Web/
   directory of Flow.
2) Adjust the file permissions. On Linux / Mac just run
   ``sudo ./flow flow:core:setfilepermissions johndoe wwwuser wwwgroup``
   from Flow's main directory (replace the user names by some matching
   your system environment!).
3) Call the URL leading to your virtual host from a browser

Have fun!
